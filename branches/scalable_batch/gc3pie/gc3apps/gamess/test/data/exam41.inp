! EXAM 41.
!   This job illustrates TDDFT/BLYP/6-31+G(d) for
!   the 3 lowest singlet excited states of CO.
!   Note the use of diffuse functions in the basis
!   set, since excited states often have Rydberg
!   character.
!
!   The geometry is optimized at the BLYP level,
!   and is slightly longer than R0(exp)=1.128323.
!   experimental Te is 8.06 to 1-pi,
!                      8.17 to 1-sigma-minus
!   Computational results on the log file show you
!   that these two states arise from sigma->pi*,
!   and pi->pi* excitations, respectively.
!
!   Of course, the first excited state need not
!   have the same geometry as the ground state,
!   so its gradient is rather big.

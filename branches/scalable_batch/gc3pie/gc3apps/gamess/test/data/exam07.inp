! EXAM07.
!    1-A' HPO    RHF calculation using GAMESS.
!    This job tests the HONDO integral and gradient package,
!    due to the d function on phosphorus.  The input also
!    illustrates the use of a more flexible basis set than
!    the methylene examples.
!    Although HUCKEL would be better, HCORE is tested.
!
!    The initial energy is -397.591203190,
!    the FINAL E= -414.0945320827 after 18 iterations,
!    The dipole moment is 2.535169.
!    The RMS gradient is 0.023723712.

 Installation of GC3Pie
------------------------


Quick start
===========

We provide an installation script which automatically try to install
GC3pie in your home directory.  The quick installation procedure has
only been tested on variants of the GNU/Linux operating
system. (However, the script should work on MacOSX as well, provided
you follow the preparation steps outlined in the "MacOSX installation"
section below.)

To install GC3Pie just type this at your terminal prompt::

    sh -c "$(wget -O- http://gc3pie.googlecode.com/svn/install.sh)"

The above command creates a directory `$HOME/gc3pie`:file: and installs
the latest release of GC3Pie and all its dependencies into it.

In case you have trouble running the installation script, please send
an email to gc3pie@googlegroups.com asking for help.  Include the full
output of the script in your email, in order to help us to identify
the problem.


Non-standard installation options
=================================

The installation script accept a few options that select alternatives
to the standard behavior.  In order to use these options, you have to:

1. download the installation script into a file named `install.sh`:file:::

     wget http://gc3pie.googlecode.com/svn/install.sh

2. run the command::

     sh ./install.sh [options]

   replacing the string ``[options]`` with the actual options you want
   to pass to the script.

The accepted options are as follows:


  ``-d DIRECTORY``

      Install GC3Pie in location ``DIRECTORY`` instead of
      ``$HOME/gc3pie``

  ``--overwrite``

      Overwrite the destination directory if it already
      exists. Default behavior is to abort installation.

  ``--develop``

      Instead of installing the latest *release* of GC3Pie, it will
      install the *development branch* from the SVN repository.

  ``--yes``

      Run non-interactively, and assume a "yes" reply to every
      question.

  ``-p PYTHON``

      Uses the given ``PYTHON`` program as python interpreter.  By
      default the installation script looks for a ``python`` binary in
      the standard ``$PATH``.

  ``--no-gc3apps``

       Do not install any of the GC3Apps, e.g., ``gcodeml``,
       ``grosetta`` and ``ggamess``.


Manual installation
===================

In case you can't or don't want to use the automatic installation
script, the following instructions will guide you through all the
steps needed to manually install GC3Pie on your computer.

These instructions show how to install GC3Pie from the GC3 source
repository into a separate python environment (called `virtualenv`_).
Installation into a virtualenv has two distinct advantages:

  * All code is confined in a single directory,
    and can thus be easily replaced/removed.

  * Better dependency handling: additional Python packages
    that GC3Pie depends upon can be installed even if they
    conflict with system-level packages.

0. Install software prerequisites:

   * On Debian/Ubuntu, install packages: ``subversion``,
     ``python-dev``, ``python-profiler`` and the C/C++ compiler::

       apt-get install subversion python-dev python-profiler gcc g++

   * On CentOS5, install packages ``subversion`` and ``python-devel``
     and the C/C++ compiler::

       yum install subversion python-devel gcc gcc-c++

   * On other Linux distributions, you will need to install:

     - the ``svn`` command (from the SubVersion_ VCS)
     - Python development headers and libraries
       (for installing extension libraries written in C/C++)
     - the Python package ``pstats`` (it's part of the Python
       standard library, but sometimes it needs separate installation)
     - a C/C++ compiler (this is usually installed by default).

   If you intend to use also the ARC backend (required for SMSCG), 
   you need the NorduGrid/ARC binaries and a working ``slcs-init`` command
   installed on the same machine where GC3Pie is.  You can find
   instructions for installing it at:

     http://www.smscg.ch/WP/middleware/ARC1/smscg_ui_Installation.html

   Additional OS-specific installation details can be found at:

     http://code.google.com/p/gc3pie/wiki/OSSpecificInstallDetails


1. If `virtualenv`_ is not already installed on your system, 
   get the Python package and install it::

      wget http://pypi.python.org/packages/source/v/virtualenv/virtualenv-1.7.tar.gz
      tar -xzf virtualenv-1.7.tar.gz && rm virtualenv-1.7.tar.gz
      cd virtualenv-1.7/

   If you are installing as `root`, the following command is all you
   need::

      python setup.py install

   If instead you are installing as a normal, unprivileged user,
   things get more complicated::

      export PYTHONPATH=$HOME/lib64/python:$HOME/lib/python:$PYTHONPATH
      export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin
      mkdir -p $HOME/lib/python
      python setup.py install --home $HOME

   You will also *have to* add the two `export` lines above to the:

   * `$HOME/.bashrc` file, if using the `bash` shell or to the
   * `$HOME/.cshrc` file, if using the `tcsh` shell.
 
   In any case, once `virtualenv` has been installed, you can exit
   its directory and remove it::

      cd ..
      rm -rf virtualenv-1.7


2. Create a virtualenv to host the GC3Pie installation, and ``cd``
   into it::

       virtualenv --system-site-packages $HOME/gc3pie
       cd $HOME/gc3pie/
       source bin/activate

   In this step and in the following ones, the directory
   ``$HOME/gc3pie`` is going to be the installation folder of GC3Pie. 
   You can change this to another directory path; any directory that's
   writable by your Linux account will be OK.

   If you are installing system-wide as ``root``, we suggest you
   install GC3Pie into ``/opt/gc3pie`` instead.


3. Check-out the ``gc3pie`` files in a ``src/`` directory::

       svn co http://gc3pie.googlecode.com/svn/branches/2.0/gc3pie src


4. Install the ``gc3pie`` in "develop" mode, so any modification
   pulled from subversion is immediately reflected in the running environment::

       cd src/
       env CC=gcc ./setup.py develop
       cd .. # back into the `gc3pie` directory

   This will place all the GC3Pie command into the ``gc3pie/bin/``
   directory.


5. GC3Pie comes with driver scripts to run and manage large families
   of jobs from a few selected applications.  These scripts are not
   installed by default because not everyone needs them.

   Run the following commands to install the driver scripts for the
   applications you need::

     # if you are insterested in GAMESS, do the following
     ln -s '../src/gc3apps/gamess/ggamess.py' bin/ggamess

     # if you are insterested in Rosetta, do the following
     ln -s '../src/gc3apps/rosetta/gdocking.py' bin/gdocking
     ln -s '../src/gc3apps/rosetta/grosetta.py' bin/grosetta

     # if you are insterested in Codeml, do the following
     ln -s '../src/gc3apps/codeml/gcodeml.py' bin/gcodeml


6. Before you can actually run the GC3Pie, you need to have a
   working configuration file; `the ConfigurationFile Wiki page <http://code.google.com/p/gc3pie/wiki/ConfigurationFile/>`_
   provides an explanation of the syntax.

   The `example configuration file <http://gc3pie.googlecode.com/svn/branches/2.0/gc3pie/gc3libs/etc/gc3pie.conf.example/>`_
   can be used as a startup point if you want to enable access to the SMSCG_ infrastructure.  
   Before you can actually use this file, you will need to: 
   
   * insert into it three values, for which we `can NOT` provide defaults:

    1. ``aai_username``:
        This is the "username" you are asked for when accessing
        any SWITCHaai_/Shibboleth web page, e.g., https://gc3-aai01.uzh.ch/secure/

    2. ``idp``:
        Find this out with the command "slcs-info": it prints a list of
        IdP (Identity Provider IDs) followed by the human-readable name
        of the associated institution. Pick the one that corresponds to
        you University.  It is always the last two components of the
        University's Internet domain name (e.g., "uzh.ch" or "ethz.ch").

    3. ``vo``:
        In order to use SMSCG, you must sign up to a VO (Virtual
        Organisation).  One the words "life", "earth", "atlas" or
        "crypto" should be here. Find out more at:  http://www.smscg.ch/www/user/


    Please, remember to uncomment the three lines, too.       

   * Enable the SMSCG_ resource in the ``Examples`` section of the file.
     To do this simply uncomment the following lines::

        # [resource/smscg]
        # enabled = false
        # name = smscg
        # type = arc0
        # auth = smscg
        # arc_ldap = ldap://giis.smscg.ch:2135/o=grid/mds-vo-name=Switzerland
        # max_cores_per_job = 256
        # max_memory_per_core = 2
        # max_walltime = 24
        # ncores = 8000
        # architecture = i686, x86_64
    
7. Now you can check your GC3Pie installation; just type the command:: 

     gc3utils --help

   and you should see the following output appear on your screen::

     Usage: gc3utils COMMAND [options]

     Command `gc3utils` is a unified front-end to computing resources.
     You can get more help on a specific sub-command by typing::
       gc3utils COMMAND --help
     where command is one of these:
       clean
       get
       info
       kill
       list
       resub
       stat
       tail

   If you get some errors, do not despair!  The `GC3Pie users
   mailing-list <gc3pie@googlegroups.com>` is there to help you :-)


.. _upgrade:

Upgrade
=======

If you used the installation script, the fastest way to upgrade is just to reinstall:

0. De-activate the current GC3Pie virtual environment::

     deactivate 

   (If you get an error "command not found", do not worry and proceed
   on to the next step; in case of other errors please stop here and
   report to the `GC3Pie users mailing-list
   <mailto:gc3pie.googlegroups.com>`.)

1. Move the `$HOME/gc3pie`:file: directory to another location, e.g.::

     mv $HOME/gc3pie $HOME/gc3pie.OLD

2. Reinstall GC3Pie using the quick-install script (top of this page).

3. Once you have verified that your new installation is working, you
   can remove the `$HOME/gc3pie.OLD`:file: directory.

If instead you installed GC3Pie using the "manual installation" instructions,
then the following steps will update GC3Pie to the latest version
in the code repository:

1. `cd`:command: to the directory containing the GC3Pie virtualenv;
   assuming it is named ``gc3pie`` as in the above installation
   instructions, you can issue the commands::

     cd $HOME/gc3pie # use '/opt/gc3pie' if root

2. Activate the virtualenv::

     source bin/activate

3. Upgrade the `gc3pie` source and run the `setup.py`:file: script again::

     cd src
     svn up
     env CC=gcc ./setup.py develop

*Note:* A major restructuring of the SVN repository took place in
r1124 to r1126 (Feb. 15, 2011); if your sources are older than SVN
r1124, these upgrade instructions will not work, and you must
*reinstall completely*.  You can check what version the SVN sources
are, by running the `svn info` command in the `src` directory: watch
out for the `Revision:` line.


MacOSX Installation
===================

Installation on MacOSX machines is possible, however there are still a
few issues.  Please let us know on the `GC3Pie users mailing-list
<mailto:gc3pie@googlegroups.com>` if you need MacOSX support.

1) Standard usage of the installation script (i.e., with no options) works.

2) Options can only be given in the abbreviated one-letter form (e.g.,
   ``-d``); the long form (e.g., ``--directory``) will not work.

2) The `shellcmd` backend of GC3Pie depends on the GNU ``time``
   command, which is not installed on MacOSX by default. This means
   that with a standard MacOSX installation the `shellcmd` resource
   will **not** work. However:

   * other resources, like `pbs` via `ssh` transport, will work.

   * you can install the GNU time command either via `MacPorts`_,
     `Fink`_ or from the `this url`_. After installing it you don't
     need to update your ``PATH`` environment variable, it's enough to
     set the ``time_cmd`` option in your GC3Pie configuration file.

4) At the time of this writing, `the ARC client libraries are not
   available on MacOSX`__, so ARC backends will not work.

HTML Documentation
==================

HTML documentation for the GC3Libs programming interface can be
read online at:

  http://gc3pie.googlecode.com/svn/branches/2.0/gc3pie/docs/html/index.html

If you installed GC3Pie manually, or if you installed it using the
``install.sh`` script with the ``--develop`` option, you can also
access a local copy of the documentation from the sources::

  cd $HOME/gc3pie # or wherever the gc3pie virtualenv is installed
  cd src/docs
  make html

Note that you need the Python package `Sphinx`_
in order to build the documentation locally.

Configuration File
==================


Location
--------

All commands in `GC3Apps`:ref: and `GC3Utils`:ref: read two
configuration files at startup:

  * system-wide one located at :file:``/etc/gc3/gc3pie.conf``, and
  * a user-private one at :file:``~/.gc3/gc3pie.conf``.

Both files use the same format. The system-wide one is read first, so
that users can override the system-level configuration in their private file.
Configuration data from corresponding sections in the two
configuration files is merged; the value in the user-private file
overrides the one from the system-wide configuration.

If you try to start any GC3Utils command without having a
configuration file, a sample one will be copied to the user-private
location :file:``~/.gc3/gc3pie.conf`` and an error message will be
displayed, directing you to edit the sample file before retrying.


Configuration file format
-------------------------

The GC3Pie configuration file follows the format understood by
`Python *ConfigParser* <http://docs.python.org/library/configparser.html>`, 
which is very close to the syntax used in MS-Windows ``.INI`` files.
See http://docs.python.org/library/configparser.html for reference.

The GC3Libs configuration file consists of several configuration
blocks.  Each configuration block (section) starts with a keyword in
square brackets and contains the configuration options for a specific
part.

The following sections are used by the GC3Apps/GC3Utils programs:

  - ``[DEFAULT]`` -- this is for global settings.
  - `[auth/{name}]`:file: -- these are for settings related to identity/authentication (identifying yourself to clusters & grids).
  - `[resource/{name}]`:file: -- these are for settings related to a specific computing resource (cluster, grid, etc.)

Sections with other names are allowed but will be ignored.


The ``DEFAULT`` section
-----------------------

The ``[DEFAULT]`` section is optional.  

Values defined in the ``[DEFAULT]`` section can be used to insert
values in other sections, using the ``%(name)s`` syntax.  See
documentation of the `Python *SafeConfigParser*
<http://docs.python.org/library/configparser.html>`_ object at
http://docs.python.org/library/configparser.html for an example.


``auth`` sections
-----------------

There can be more than one ``[auth]`` section.  

Each authentication section must begin with a line of the form:

    `[auth/{name}]`:file:

where the `{name}`:file: portion is any alphanumeric string.

You can have as many `[auth/{name}]`:file: sections as you want; any
name is allowed provided it's composed only of letters, numbers and
the underscore character ``_``.

This allows you to define different auth methods for different
resources.  Each `[resource/{name}]`:file: section will reference one
(and one only) authentication section.


Authentication types
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each ``auth`` section *must* specify a ``type`` setting.

`` type `` defines the authentication type that will be used to access
a resource. There are three supported authentication types:

  * ``ssh``; use this for resources that will be accessed by opening an SSH connection to the front-end node of a cluster.
  * ``voms-proxy``: uses ``voms-proxy-init`` to generate a proxy; use for resources that require a VOMS-enabled Grid proxy.
  * ``grid-proxy``: uses ``grid-proxy-init`` to generate a proxy; use for resources that require a Grid proxy (but no VOMS extensions).

For the ``ssh``-type auth, the following keys must be provided:

  * ``type``: must be ``ssh``
  * ``username``: must be the username to log in as on the remote machine

Any other key/value pair will be ignored.

For the ``voms-proxy`` type auth, the following keys must be provided:

  * ``type``: must be ``voms-proxy``
  * ``vo``: the VO to authenticate with (passed directly to
    ``voms-proxy-init`` as argument to the ``--vo`` command-line
    switch)
  * ``cert_renewal_method``: see below.
  * ``remember_password``: see below.

Any other key/value pair will be ignored.

For the ``grid-proxy`` type auth, the following keys must be provided:

  * ``type``: must be ``grid-proxy``
  * ``cert_renewal_method``: see below.
  * ``remember_password``: see below.

Any other key/value pair will be ignored.

For the ``voms-proxy`` and ``grid-proxy`` authentication types, the
``cert_renewal_method`` setting specifies whether GC3Libs should attempt
to get a certificate if the current one is expired or otherwise invalid.
Currently there are two supported ``cert_renewal_method`` types:

  * ``slcs``: user certificate is generated through an invocation of the ``slcs-init``:command: program.
  * ``manual``: user certificate is generated/renewed though an
    external process and has to be performed by the user outside of
    the scope of GC3Pie. In this case, if the user certificate is expired,
    invalid or non-existent, GC3Pie will fail to authenticate.

For the ``slcs`` certificate renewal method, the  following keys must be provided:

  * ``aai_username``: passed directly to `slcs-init`:command: as argument to the ``--user`` command-line switch.
  * ``idp``: passed directly to `slcs-init`:command: as argument to the ``--idp`` command-line switch.

For the ``manual`` certificate renewal method, no additional keys are required.

The ``remember_password`` entry (optional) must be set to a boolean
value (the strings ``1`, ``yes``, ``true`` and ``on`` are interpreted
as boolean "true"; any other value counts as "false").  If set to a
true value, the ``remember_password`` entry instructs GC3Pie to keep
the password used for this authentication in the program's main
memory; this implies that you will be asked for the password at most
once per program invocation.  This setting is optional, and defaults
to "false". Keeping passwords in memory is bad security practice; do
not set this option to "true" unless you understand the implications.

*Example 1.* The following example ``auth`` section shows how to
configure GC3Pie for using SWITCHaai_ SLCS_ services to generate a
certificate and a VOMS_ proxy to access the Swiss National Distributed
Computing Infrastructure SMSCG_:: 

    [auth/smscg]
    type = voms-proxy
    cert_renewal_method = slcs
    aai_username = <aai_user_name> # SWITCHaai/Shibboleth user name
    idp= uzh.ch
    vo = smscg

*Example 2.* The following configuration sections are used to set up
two different accounts, that GC3Pie programs can use.  Which account
should be used on which computational resource is defined in the
`resource sections`_ (see below). ::

    [auth/ssh1]
    type = ssh
    username = murri # your username here

    [auth/ssh2] # I use a different account name on some resources
    type = ssh
    username = rmurri

.. _voms: http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/components/voms.html


``resource`` sections
---------------------

Each resource section must begin with a line of the form:

    `[resource/{name}]`:file:

You can have as many :file:`[resource/{name}]` sections as you want; this
allows you to define many different resources.  Each `[resource/{name}]`:file:
section must reference one (and one only) `[auth/{name}]`:file:
section (by its ``auth`` key).

Resources currently come in several flavours, distinguished by the
value of the ``type`` key:

  * If ``type`` is ``arc1``, then the resource is accessed using the ARC grid middleware (version 1.1.x/1.0.x);
  * If ``type`` is ``arc0``, then the resource is accessed using the ARC grid middleware (version 0.8.x);
  * If ``type`` is ``sge``, then the resource is a `Grid Engine`_ batch system, to be accessed by an SSH connection to its front-end node.
  * If ``type`` is ``shellcmd``, then the resource is the computer where the GC3Pie script is running and applications are executed by just spawning a local UNIX process.

All `[resource/{name}]`:file: sections (except those of ``shellcmd``
type) *must* reference a valid ``auth/***`` section. Resources of
``sge`` type can only reference :command:``ssh`` type sections.;
resources of type ``arc0`` or ``arc1`` can only reference
``[auth/***]`` sections whose type is ``voms-proxy`` or
``grid-proxy``.

Some configuration keys are commmon to all resource types:

  *  ``type``: Resource type, see above.
  *  ``auth``: the name of a valid `[auth/{name}]`:file: section; only the authentication section name (after the ``/``) must be specified.
  *  ``max_cores_per_job``: Maximum number of CPU cores that a job can request; a resource will be dropped during the brokering process if a job requests more cores than this.
  *  ``max_memory_per_core``: Max amount of memory (expressed in GBs) that a job can request.
  *  ``max_walltime``: Maximum job running time (in hours).
  *  ``max_cores``: Total number of cores provided by the resource.
  *  ``architecture``: Processor architecture.  Should be one of the strings ``x86_64`` (for 64-bit Intel/AMD/VIA processors), ``i686`` (for 32-bit Intel/AMD/VIA x86 processors), or ``x86_64,i686`` if both architectures are available on the resource.
  *  ``time_cmd``: Used only when ``type`` is ``shellcmd``. The `time` program is used as wrapper for the application in order to collect informations about the execution when running without a real `LRMS`.

``arc0`` resources
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``arc_ldap`` key should be set to the LDAP URL of an ARC GIIS or
GRIS.  If, in addition, the ``frontend`` key is also defined, then
only queues belonging to the specified frontend will be considered for
brokering.

When a job has just been submitted, the ARC information system does
not immediately report about it: the job will appear at the next cache
update.  This creates a time window during which no information is
reported about the job by ARC, as if it never existed.  In order not
to mistake this for a "job lost" error, GC3Libs allow a "grace time":
job information lookups are allowed to fail for a certain time span
after submission. The duration of this time span is set with the optional
``lost_job_timeout`` parameter, whose default is 4 times the ARC default
cache time; this parameter should not be lower than twice the
information system update frequency.

  * ``lost_job_timeout``: Time (in seconds) a failure in job lookup in the information system will *not* be considered critical


``arc1`` resources
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``arc_ldap`` key should be defined to a valid ARC1 information system URL.

When a job has just been submitted, the ARC information system does
not immediately report about it: the job will appear at the next cache
update.  This creates a time window during which no information is
reported about the job by ARC, as if it never existed.  In order not
to mistake this for a "job lost" error, GC3Libs allow a "grace time":
job information lookups are allowed to fail for a certain time span
after submission. The duration of this time span is set with the optional
``lost_job_timeout`` parameter, whose default is 4 times the ARC default
cache time; this parameter should not be lower than twice the
information system update frequency.

  * ``lost_job_timeout``: Time (in seconds) a failure in job lookup in the information system will *not* be considered critical


``sge`` resources
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following configuration keys are required in a ``sge``-type resource section:

  * ``frontend``: should contain the `FQDN (Fully-qualified domain name)`:abbr: of the SGE front-end node. An SSH connection will be attempted to this node, in order to submit jobs and retrieve status info.
  * ``transport``: Possible values are: ``ssh`` or ``local``.   If ``ssh``, we try to connect to the host specified in ``frontend`` via SSH in order to execute SGE commands.  If ``local``, the SGE commands are run directly on the machine where GC3Pie is installed.

Since the installation path to supported applications is not known (there
is no information system, differently from ARC), then the path must be
specified here:

  * ``gamess_location``: UNIX path name of the directory containing a valid `qgms`:command: script

When a job has finished, the SGE batch system does not (by default)
immediately write its information into the accounting database.  This
creates a time window during which no information is reported about
the job by SGE, as if it never existed.  In order not to mistake this
for a "job lost" error, GC3Libs allow a "grace time": `qacct`:command: job
information lookups are allowed to fail for a certain time span after
the first time `qstat`:command: failed. The duration of this time span is set
with the ``sge_accounting_delay`` parameter, whose default is 15 seconds
(matches the default in SGE, as of release 6.2): 

  * ``sge_accounting_delay``: Time (in seconds) a failure in `qacct`:command: will *not* be considered critical.


Example ``resource`` sections
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Example 1.* This configuration stanza defines a resource ``smscg``
representing the whole SMSCG_ infrastructure, accessed through the ARC
(version 0.8.x) middleware::

    [resource/smscg]
    # A whole ARC-based Grid
    type = arc0
    auth = <voms_auth_name>
    arc_ldap = ldap://giis.smscg.ch:2135/o=grid/mds-vo-name=Switzerland
    # These values are correct as of 2011-02-28; please
    # ask on the SMSCG mailing list if unsure.
    max_cores_per_job = 256
    max_memory_per_core = 3
    max_walltime = 9999
    ncores = 1200
    architecture = x86_64, i686

*Example 2.* This configuration stanza shows how to access a single
cluster through the ARC middleware (version 1.x) using the name
``idgc3grid01`` (which is also the internet host name of the cluster
front-end)::

    [resource/idgc3grid01]
    # A single cluster, accessed through the ARC middleware
    type = arc
    auth = <auth_name> # pick a ``voms`` type auth
    frontend = idgc3grid01.uzh.ch
    name = gc3
    arc_ldap = ldap://idgc3grid01.uzh.ch:2135/mds-vo-name=local,o=grid
    max_cores_per_job = 32
    max_memory_per_core = 2
    max_walltime = 12
    ncores = 80

*Example 3.* This configuration stanza defines a resource to submit
jobs to the `Grid Engine`_ cluster whose front-end host is
``ocikbpra.uzh.ch``::

    [resource/ocikbpra]
    # A single SGE cluster, accessed by SSH'ing to the front-end node
    type = sge
    auth = <auth_name> # pick an ``ssh`` type auth, e.g., "ssh1"
    transport = ssh
    frontend = ocikbpra.uzh.ch
    gamess_location = /share/apps/gamess
    max_cores_per_job = 80
    max_memory_per_core = 2
    max_walltime = 2
    ncores = 80


Enabling/disabling selected resources
-------------------------------------

Any resource can be disabled by adding a line ``enabled = false`` to its
configuration stanza.  Conversely, a line ``enabled = true`` will undo
the effect of an ``enabled = false`` line (possibly found in a different
configuration file).

This way, resources can be temporarily disabled (e.g., the cluster is
down for maintenance) without having to remove them from the
configuration file.

You can selectively disable or enable resources that are defined in
the system-wide configuration file.  Two main use cases are supported:
the system-wide configuration file :file:``/etc/gc3/gc3pie.conf`` lists and
enables all available resources, and users can turn them off in their
private configuration file :file:``~/.gc3/gc3pie.conf``; or the system-wide
configuration can list all available resources but keep them disabled,
and users can enable those they prefer in the private configuration
file.

<p>GC3Libs is a python package for controlling the life-cycle of a Grid
or batch computational job.</p>
<p>GC3Libs provides services for submitting computational jobs to Grids
and batch systems, controlling their execution, persisting job
information, and retrieving the final output.</p>
<p>GC3Libs takes an application-oriented approach to batch computing. A
generic <cite>Application</cite> class provides the basic operations for
controlling remote computations, but different <cite>Application</cite>
subclasses can expose adapted interfaces, focusing on the most
relevant aspects of the application being represented.</p>
<p>This document is the technical reference for the GC3Libs programming
model, aimed at programmers who want to use GC3Libs to implement
computational workflows in Python.</p>

<h2>Overview<a class="headerlink" href="#overview" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>GC3Libs takes an application-oriented approach to asynchronous
computing. A generic <tt class="xref docutils literal"><span class="pre">Application</span></tt> class provides the basic
operations for controlling remote computations and fetching a result;
client code should derive specialized sub-classes to deal with a
particular application, and to perform any application-specific
pre- and post-processing.</p>
<p>The generic procedure for performing computations with GC3Libs is the
following:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Client code creates an instance of an <cite>Application</cite> sub-class.</li>
<li>Asynchronous computation is started by submitting the application
object; this associates the application with an actual (possibly
remote) computational job.</li>
<li>Client code can monitor the state of the computational job; state
handlers are called on the application object as the state
changes.</li>
<li>When the job is done, the final output is retrieved and a
post-processing method is invoked on the application object.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>At this point, results of the computation are available and can be
used by the calling program.</p>
<p>The <tt class="xref docutils literal"><span class="pre">Application</span></tt> class (and its sub-classes) alow client code
to control the above process by:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first">Specifying the characteristics (computer program to run,
input/output files, memory/CPU/duration requirements, etc.) of the
corresponding computational job.  This is done by passing suitable
values to the <tt class="xref docutils literal"><span class="pre">Application</span></tt> constructor.  See the
<tt class="xref docutils literal"><span class="pre">Application</span></tt> constructor documentation for more info.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Providing methods to control the &#8220;life-cycle&#8221; of the associated
computational job: start, check execution state, stop, retrieve a
snapshot of the output files.  There are actually two different
interfaces for this, detailed below:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first">A <em>passive</em> interface: a <tt class="xref docutils literal"><span class="pre">Core</span></tt> or a
<tt class="xref docutils literal"><span class="pre">Engine</span></tt> object is used to start/stop/monitor jobs
associated with the given application.  For instance:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">GamessApplication</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">...</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="c"># create a `Core` object; only one instance is needed</span>
<span class="n">g</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">Core</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">...</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="c"># start the remote computation</span>
<span class="n">g</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">submit</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">a</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="c"># periodically monitor job execution</span>
<span class="n">g</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">update_job_state</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">a</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="c"># retrieve output when the job is done</span>
<span class="n">g</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">fetch_output</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">a</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The passive interface gives client code full control over
the lifecycle of the job, but cannot support some use cases
(e.g., automatic application re-start).</p>
<p>As you can see from the above example, the passive interface
is implemented by methods in the <tt class="xref docutils literal"><span class="pre">Core</span></tt> and
<tt class="xref docutils literal"><span class="pre">Engine</span></tt> classes (they implement the same
interface).  See those classes documentation for more details.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">An <em>active</em> interface: this requires that the
<tt class="xref docutils literal"><span class="pre">Application</span></tt> object be attached to a <tt class="xref docutils literal"><span class="pre">Core</span></tt>
or <tt class="xref docutils literal"><span class="pre">Engine</span></tt> instance:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">GamessApplication</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">...</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="c"># create a `Core` object; only one instance is needed</span>
<span class="n">g</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">Core</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">...</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="c"># tell application to use the active interface</span>
<span class="n">a</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">attach</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">g</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="c"># start the remote computation</span>
<span class="n">a</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">submit</span><span class="p">()</span>

<span class="c"># periodically monitor job execution</span>
<span class="n">a</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">update_job_state</span><span class="p">()</span>

<span class="c"># retrieve output when the job is done</span>
<span class="n">a</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">fetch_output</span><span class="p">()</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>With the active interface, application objects can support
automated restart and similar use-cases.</p>
<p>When an <tt class="xref docutils literal"><span class="pre">Engine</span></tt> object is used instead of a
<tt class="xref docutils literal"><span class="pre">Core</span></tt> one, the job life-cycle is automatically
managed, providing a fully asynchronous way of executing
computations.</p>
<p>The active interface is implemented by the <tt class="xref docutils literal"><span class="pre">Task</span></tt>
class and all its descendants (including <tt class="xref docutils literal"><span class="pre">Application</span></tt>).</p>
</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Providing &#8220;state transition methods&#8221; that are called when a
change in the job execution state is detected; those methods can
implement application specific behavior, like restarting the
computational job with changed input if the alloted duration has
expired but the computation has not finished.  In particular, a
<cite>postprocess</cite> method is called when the final output of an
application is available locally for processing.</p>
<p>The set of &#8220;state transition methods&#8221; currently implemented by
the <tt class="xref docutils literal"><span class="pre">Application</span></tt> class are: <tt class="xref docutils literal"><span class="pre">new()</span></tt>,
<tt class="xref docutils literal"><span class="pre">submitted()</span></tt>, <tt class="xref docutils literal"><span class="pre">running()</span></tt>, <tt class="xref docutils literal"><span class="pre">stopped()</span></tt>,
<tt class="xref docutils literal"><span class="pre">terminated()</span></tt> and <tt class="xref docutils literal"><span class="pre">postprocess()</span></tt>.  Each method is
called when the execution state of an application object changes
to the corresponding state; see each method&#8217;s documentation for
exact information.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>In addition, GC3Libs provides <em>collection</em> classes, that expose
interfaces <em>2.</em> and <em>3.</em> above, allowing one to control a set of
applications as a single whole.  Collections can be nested (i.e., a
collection can hold a mix of <tt class="xref docutils literal"><span class="pre">Application</span></tt> and
<tt class="xref docutils literal"><span class="pre">TaskCollection</span></tt> objects), so that workflows can be implemented
by composing collection objects.</p>
<p>Note that the term <em>computational job</em> (or just <em>job</em>, for short) is
used here in a quite general sense, to mean any kind of computation
that can happen independently of the main thread of the calling
program.  GC3Libs currently provide means to execute a job as a
separate process on the same computer, or as a batch job on a remote
computational cluster.</p>
<div class="section" id="execution-model-of-gc3libs-applications">
<h3>Execution model of GC3Libs applications<a class="headerlink" href="#execution-model-of-gc3libs-applications" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>An <cite>Application</cite> can be regarded as an abstraction of an independent
asynchronous computation, i.e., a GC3Libs&#8217; <cite>Application</cite> behaves much
like an independent UNIX process (but it can actually run on a
separate remote computer). Indeed, GC3Libs&#8217; <cite>Application</cite> objects
mimic the POSIX process model: <cite>Application</cite> are started by a
parent process, run independently of it, and need to have their final
exit code and output reaped by the calling process.</p>
<p>The following table makes the correspondence between POSIX processes
and GC3Libs&#8217; <cite>Application</cite> objects explicit.</p>

<li>With GC3Libs, it is not possible to send an arbitrary signal to

<div class="section" id="application-exit-codes">
<h4>Application exit codes<a class="headerlink" href="#application-exit-codes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>POSIX encodes process termination information in the &#8220;return code&#8221;,
which can be parsed through <cite>os.WEXITSTATUS</cite>, <cite>os.WIFSIGNALED</cite>,
<cite>os.WTERMSIG</cite> and relative library calls.</p>
<p>Likewise, GC3Libs provides each <tt class="xref docutils literal"><span class="pre">Application</span></tt> object with an
<cite>execution.returncode</cite> attribute, which is a valid POSIX &#8220;return
code&#8221;.  Client code can therefore use <cite>os.WEXITSTATUS</cite> and relatives
to inspect it; convenience attributes <cite>execution.signal</cite> and
<cite>execution.exitcode</cite> are available for direct access to the parts of
the return code.  See <tt class="xref docutils literal"><span class="pre">Run.returncode()</span></tt> for more information.</p>
<p>However, GC3Libs has to deal with error conditions that are not
catered for by the POSIX process model: for instance, execution of an
application may fail because of an error connecting to the remote
execution cluster.</p>
<p>To this purpose, GC3Libs encodes information about abnormal job
termination using a set of pseudo-signal codes in a job&#8217;s
<cite>execution.returncode</cite> attribute: i.e., if termination of a job is due
to some grid/batch system/middleware error, the job&#8217;s
<cite>os.WIFSIGNALED(app.execution.returncode)</cite> will be <cite>True</cite> and the
signal code (as gotten from <cite>os.WTERMSIG(app.execution.returncode)</cite>)
will be one of those listed in the <tt class="xref docutils literal"><span class="pre">Run.Signals</span></tt> documentation.</p>

<p>At any given moment, a GC3Libs job is in any one of a set of
pre-defined states, listed in the table below.  The job state is
always available in the <cite>.execution.state</cite> instance property of any
<cite>Application</cite> or <cite>Task</cite> object; see <tt class="xref docutils literal"><span class="pre">Run.state()</span></tt> for detailed

<p>When an <tt class="xref docutils literal"><span class="pre">Application</span></tt> object is first created, its
<cite>.execution.state</cite> attribute is assigned the state NEW.  After a
successful start (via <cite>Core.submit()</cite> or similar), it is transitioned
to state SUBMITTED.  Further transitions to RUNNING or STOPPED or
TERMINATED state, happen completely independently of the creator
program: the <cite>Core.update_job_state()</cite> call provides updates on the
status of a job. (Somewhat like the POSIX <cite>wait(..., WNOHANG)</cite> system
call, except that GC3Libs provide explicit RUNNING and STOPPED states,
instead of encoding them into the return value.)</p>
<p>The STOPPED state is a kind of generic &#8220;run time error&#8221; state: a job
can get into the STOPPED state if its execution is stopped (e.g., a
SIGSTOP is sent to the remote process) or delayed indefinitely (e.g.,
the remote batch system puts the job &#8220;on hold&#8221;). There is no way a job
can get out of the STOPPED state automatically: all transitions from the
STOPPED state require manual intervention, either by the submitting
user (e.g., cancel the job), or by the remote systems administrator
(e.g., by releasing the hold).</p>
<p>The TERMINATED state is the final state of a job: once a job reaches
it, it cannot get back to any other state. Jobs reach TERMINATED state
regardless of their exit code, or even if a system failure occurred
during remote execution; actually, jobs can reach the TERMINATED
status even if they didn&#8217;t run at all!</p>
<p>A job that is not in the NEW or TERMINATED state is said to be a &#8220;live&#8221; job.</p>

<h4>Computational job specification<a class="headerlink" href="#computational-job-specification" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>One of the purposes of GC3Libs is to provide an abstraction layer
that frees client code from dealing with the details of job execution
on a possibly remote cluster. For this to work, it necessary to
specify job characteristics and requirements, so that the GC3Libs
scheduler can select an appropriate computational resource for
executing the job.</p>
<p>GC3Libs <cite>Application</cite> provide a way to describe computational job
characteristics (program to run, input and output files,

<p>When a <a title="gc3libs.Run" class="reference internal" href="#gc3libs.Run"><tt class="xref docutils literal"><span class="pre">Run</span></tt></a> object is first created, it is assigned
the state NEW.  After a successful invocation of
<cite>Core.submit()</cite>, it is transitioned to state SUBMITTED.
Further transitions to RUNNING or STOPPED or TERMINATED state,
happen completely independently of the creator progra; the
<cite>Core.update_job_state()</cite> call provides updates on the status
of a job.</p>
<p>The STOPPED state is a kind of generic &#8220;run time error&#8221; state:
a job can get into the STOPPED state if its execution is
stopped (e.g., a SIGSTOP is sent to the remote process) or
delayed indefinitely (e.g., the remote batch system puts the
job &#8220;on hold&#8221;). There is no way a job can get out of the
STOPPED state automatically: all transitions from the STOPPED
state require manual intervention, either by the submitting
user (e.g., cancel the job), or by the remote systems
administrator (e.g., by releasing the hold).</p>
<p>The TERMINATED state is the final state of a job: once a job
reaches it, it cannot get back to any other state. Jobs reach
TERMINATED state regardless of their exit code, or even if a
system failure occurred during remote execution; actually,
jobs can reach the TERMINATED status even if they didn&#8217;t run
at all, for example, in case of a fatal failure during the
submission step.</p>

be computed per-queue, but a host can belong in different queues
at the same time; therefore the number of &#8216;free&#8217; slots available
to a job actually depends on the queue it is submitted to.  Since
SGE does not force users to submit explicitly to a queue, rather
encourages use of a sort of &#8216;implicit&#8217; routing queue, there is no
way to compute the number of free slots, as this entirely depends
on how local policies will map a job to the available queues.</p>

<p>Generic Python programming utility functions.</p>
<p>This module collects general utility functions, not specifically
related to GC3Libs.  A good rule of thumb for determining if a
function or class belongs in here is the following: place a function
or class in the <tt class="xref docutils literal"><span class="pre">utils</span></tt> if you could copy its code into the

<dd><p>A generic enumeration class.  Inspired by:
<a class="reference external" href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/36932/whats-the-best-way-to-implement-an-enum-in-python/2182437#2182437">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/36932/whats-the-best-way-to-implement-an-enum-in-python/2182437#2182437</a>
with some more syntactic sugar added.</p>
<p>An <cite>Enum</cite> class must be instanciated with a list of strings, that
make the enumeration &#8220;label&#8221;:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">Animal</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">Enum</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&#39;CAT&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&#39;DOG&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Each label is available as an instance attribute, evaluating to
itself:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">Animal</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">DOG</span>
<span class="go">&#39;DOG&#39;</span>

<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">Animal</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">CAT</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s">&#39;CAT&#39;</span>
<span class="go">True</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>As a consequence, you can test for presence of an enumeration
label by string value:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="s">&#39;DOG&#39;</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">Animal</span>
<span class="go">True</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Finally, enumeration labels can also be iterated upon:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">Animal</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="k">print</span> <span class="n">a</span>

<p>The <cite>last</cite> method returns the text of the last message appended:</p>

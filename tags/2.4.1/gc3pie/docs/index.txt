====================================
  Welcome to GC3Pie documentation!
====================================


--------------
 Introduction
--------------

GC3Pie is a Python package for running large job campaigns on diverse
batch-oriented execution environments (for instance: a Sun/Oracle/Open
`Grid Engine`_ cluster, or the Swiss National Distributed Computing
Infrastructure SMSCG_).  It also provides facilities for implementing
command-line driver scripts, in the form of Python object classes
whose behavior can be customized by overriding specified object
methods.

GC3Pie documentation is divided in three sections:

* :ref:`User Documentation`: info on how to install, configure and
  run GC3Pie applications.

* :ref:`Programmer Documentation`: info for programmers who want to
  use the GC3Pie libraries to write their own scripts and
  applications.

* :ref:`Developer Documentation`: detailed information on how to
  contribute to GC3Pie and get your code included in the main library.

Exercise F

* implement the RetryableTask class: retry a job until it
  succeeds. Test it with the ``dice.sh`` script that rolls a dice and
  exits successfully iff the dice reads `1`.

Note: instead of using a shell script, we use the bash command::

    exit $[$RANDOM%6+1]

which will exit with an exit code between 1 and 6.

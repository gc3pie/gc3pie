!    1-A-1 CH2    MCSCF methylene geometry optimization.
!    The two configuration ansatz is the same as used in
!    the fourth example.
!
!    The optimization is done in internal coordinates,
!    as NZVAR is non-zero.   Since a explicit $ZMAT is
!    given, these are used for the internal coordinates,
!    rather than those used to enter the molecule in
!    the $DATA.  (Careful examination of this trivial
!    triatomic's input shows that $ZMAT is equivalent
!    to $DATA in this case.  You would normally give
!    $ZMAT only if it is somehow different.)
!
!    This job tests the MCSCF wavefunction and gradient.
!
!    At the initial geometry:
!    The initial energy is -37.187342653,
!    the FINAL E= -37.2562020559 after 14 iterations,
!    the RMS gradient is 0.0196185.
!
!    After 4 steps,
!    FINAL E= -37.2581791690, RMS gradient=0.0000012,
!    r(CH)=1.1243353, ang(HCH)=98.8170741

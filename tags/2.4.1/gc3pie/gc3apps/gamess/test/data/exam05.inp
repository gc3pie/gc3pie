!    CH2    CI calculation.
!    The wavefunction is RHF + CI-SD, within the minimal
!    basis, containing 55 configurations.  Two CI roots
!    are found, and the gradient of the higher state is
!    then computed.
!
!    Note that CI gradients have several restrictions,
!    which are further described in the $LAGRAN group.
!
!    FINAL energy of RHF = -38.3704885135 after 10 iters.
!    State 1 EIGENvalue = -38.4270674142, c(1)  = 0.970224
!    State 2 EIGENvalue = -38.3130036831, c(29) = 0.990865
!    The upper state's dipole moment is 0.708275 Debye
!    from the expectation value density, and 0.691104
!    from the relaxed density (it is well known that CI
!    does not satisfy the Hellmann-Feynmann theorem).
!    The upper state has RMS gradient 0.032264079

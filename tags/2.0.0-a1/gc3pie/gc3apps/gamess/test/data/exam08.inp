!    1-A-1 H2O    RHF + MP2 gradient calculation.
!    This job generates RHF orbitals which should be saved
!    for use with EXAM9.  This run, together with EXAM9,
!    shows a much more typical MCSCF calculation, which
!    should always be started with some sort of SCF MOs.
!    This job also tests the 2nd order Moller-Plesset code,
!    exercizing the parallel code for this, even if p=1.
!
!    The FINAL E is -75.5854099068 after 10 iterations.
!    E(MP2) is -75.7060362006, RMS grad=0.017449522
!    dipole moments are SCF=2.435689, MP2=2.329368

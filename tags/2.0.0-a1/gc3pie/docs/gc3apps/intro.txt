.. _`session-based script`:

Introduction to *session-based* scripts
=======================================

All GC3Apps scripts derive their core functionality from a common
blueprint, named a *session-based script*.  The purpose of this
section is to describe this common functionality; script-specific
sections detail the scope and options that are unique to a given
script.  Readers interested in Python programming can find the
complete documentation about the *session-based script* :term:`API` in
the `SessionBasedScript`:class: section.

The functioning of GC3Apps scripts revolves around a so-called
*session*.  A :term:`session` is just a named collection of jobs.  For
instance, you could group into a single session jobs that analyze a
set of related files.

Each time it is run, a GC3Apps script performs the
following steps:

1. Reads the session directory and loads all stored jobs into memory.
   If the session directory does not exist, one will be created with
   empty contents.

2. Scans the command-line input arguments: if existing jobs do not
   suffice to analyze the input data, new jobs are added to the
   session.

3. The status of all existing jobs is updated, output from finished jobs
   is collected, and new jobs are submitted.

   Finally, a summary table of all known jobs is printed.  (To control
   the amount of printed information, see the ``-l`` command-line
   option below.)

4. If the ``-C`` command-line option was given (see below), waits
   the specified amount of seconds, and then goes back to step 3.

   Execution can be interrupted at any time by pressing :kbd:`Ctrl+C`.


Basic command-line usage and options
------------------------------------

The exact command-line usage of *session-based scripts* varies from
one script to the other, so please consult the documentation page for
your application.  There are quite a number of common options and
behaviors, however, which are described here.

Continuous execution
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

While single-pass execution of a GC3Apps script is possible (and
sometimes used), it is much more common to keep the script running
and let it manage jobs until all are finished.  This is accomplished
with the following command-line option:

  -C NUM, --continuous NUM
    Keep running, monitoring jobs and possibly submitting
    new ones or fetching results every NUM seconds.

    When all jobs are finished, a GC3Apps script exits even if the
    ``-C`` option is given.

Verbose listing of jobs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Only a summary of job states is printed by default at the end of step
3., together with the count of jobs that are in the specified state.
Use the ``-l`` option (see below) to get a detailed listing of all
jobs.

  -l STATE, --state STATE
    Print a table of jobs including their status.
  
    The *STATE* argument restricts output to jobs in that particular
    state.  It can be a single :term:`state` word (e.g., ``RUNNING``)
    or a comma-separated list thereof (e.g.,
    ``NEW,SUBMITTED,RUNNING``).

    The pseudo-states ``ok`` and ``failed`` are also allowed for
    selecting jobs in ``TERMINATED`` state with exit code
    (respectively) 0 or nonzero.

    If *STATE* is omitted, no restriction is placed on job states, and
    a table of *all* jobs is printed.

Maximum number of concurrent jobs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There is a maximum number of jobs that can be in ``SUBMITTED`` or
``RUNNING`` state at a given time.  GC3Apps scripts will delay
submission of newly-created jobs so that this limit is never
exceeded.  The default limit is 50, but it can be changed with the
following command-line option:

  -J NUM, --max-running NUM
    Set the maximum NUMber of jobs (default: 50) in ``SUBMITTED``
    or ``RUNNING`` state.

Location of output files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, output files are placed in the same directory where the
corresponding input file resides.  This can be changed with the
following option; it is also possible to specify output locations that
vary depending on certain job features.

  -o DIRECTORY, --output DIRECTORY
    Output files from all jobs will be collected in the specified
    *DIRECTORY* path.  If the destination directory does not exist, it
    is created.


Job control options
-------------------

These command-line options control the requirements and constraints of
*new jobs*.  Indeed, note that changing the arguments to these options
*does not* change the corresponding requirements on jobs that already
exist in the session.

  -c NUM, --cpu-cores NUM
    Set the number of CPU cores required for each job
    (default: 1).  *NUM* must be a whole number.

  -m GIGABYTES, --memory-per-core GIGABYTES
    Set the amount of memory required per execution core,
    in gigabytes (Default: 2). Currently, *GIGABYTES* can
    only be an integer number; fractional amounts are
    discarded.

  -r NAME, --resource NAME
    Submit jobs to a specific :term:`resource`. ``NAME`` is a
    reource name or comma-separated list of resource names.
    Use the command `glist` to list available resources.

  -w DURATION, --wall-clock-time DURATION
    Set the time limit for each job (default is '8' for
    '8 hours'). Jobs exceeding this limit will be stopped
    and considered as *failed*. The duration can be
    expressed as a whole number (indicating the duration
    in hours) or as a string in the form 'hours:minutes'.


Session control options
-----------------------

This set of options control the placement and contents of the :term:`session`.

  -s PATH, --session PATH
    Store the session information in the directory at *PATH*.
    (By default, this is a subdirectory of the current directory,
    named after the script you are executing.)
    
    If *PATH* is an existing directory, it will be used for storing job
    information, and an index file (with suffix ``.csv``) will be
    created in it. Otherwise, the job information will be stored in a
    directory named after *PATH* with a suffix ``.jobs`` appended, and
    the index file will be named after *PATH* with a suffix ``.csv``
    added.

  -N, --new-session     
    Discard any information saved in the session directory
    (see the ``--session`` option) and start a new session
    afresh. Any information about jobs previously recorded
    in the session is lost.

  -u, --store-url URL
    
    Store GC3Pie job information at the persistent storage specified
    by *URL*.  The *URL* can be any form that is understood by the
    `gc3libs.persistence.make_store`:func: function (which see for
    details).  A few examples:

    * `sqlite`:file: -- the jobs are stored in a SQLite3 database
      named ``jobs.db`` and contained in the session directory.
    * `{/path/to/a/directory}`:file: -- the jobs are stored in the given
      directory, one file per job (this is the default format used by
      GC3Pie)
    * `sqlite:////{path/to/a/file.db}`:file: -- the jobs are stored in
      the given SQLite3 database file.
    * `mysql://user,passwd@{server}/{dbname}`:file: -- jobs are stored
      in table ``store`` of the specified MySQL database.  The DB
      server and connection credentials (username, password) are also
      part of the *URL*.

    If this option is omitted, GC3Pie's *SessionBasedScript* defaults
    to storing jobs in the subdirectory `jobs`:file: of the session
    directory; each job is saved in a separate file.


Exit code
---------

A GC3Apps script exits when all jobs are finished, when some error
occurred that prevented the script from completing, or when a user
interrupts it with :kbd:`Ctrl+C`

In any case, the exit code of GC3Apps scripts tracks job status (in
the following sense).  The exitcode is a bitfield; the 4
least-significant bits are assigned a meaning according to the
following table:

  ===    ============================================================
  Bit    Meaning
  ===    ============================================================
  0      Set if a fatal error occurred: the script could not complete
  1      Set if there are jobs in ``FAILED`` state
  2      Set if there are jobs in ``RUNNING`` or ``SUBMITTED`` state
  3      Set if there are jobs in ``NEW`` state
  ===    ============================================================

This boils down to the following rules:

* exitcode is 0: all jobs are `DONE`, no further action will be taken
  by the script (which exists immediately if called again on the same
  session). 
* exitcode is 1: an error interrupted the script execution.
* exitcode is 2: all jobs finished, but some are in `FAILED` state.
* exitcode > 3: run the script again to make jobs progress.

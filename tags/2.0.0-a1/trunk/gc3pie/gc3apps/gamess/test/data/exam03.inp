!    3-B-1 CH2  ROHF calculation on methylene ground state.
!    The wavefunction is a pure triplet state (<S**2> = 2),
!    and so has a higher energy than the second example.
!
!    For COORD=CART, all atoms must be given, and as in the
!    present case, these may be in an unoriented geometry.
!    GAMESS deduces which atoms are unique, and orients
!    the molecule appropriately.  The geometry here is thus
!    identical to the second example.
!
!    This job tests the ROHF wavefunction and gradient code.
!    It also tests the direct SCF procedure.
!
!    The initial energy is -37.228465066.
!    The FINAL energy is -37.2778767090 after 7 iterations.
!    Mulliken, Lowdin charges on C are -0.020346, 0.019470.
!    The Hydrogen atom spin density is 0.0129735.
!    The dipole moment is 0.025099 Debye.
!    The RMS gradient is 0.027505548

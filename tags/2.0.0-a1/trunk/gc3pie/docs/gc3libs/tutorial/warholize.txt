GC3Pie tutorial - Warholize
===========================

In this tutorial we will show you how to use GC3Pie libraries in order
to build a command line script which will run a complex workflow with
both parallel and sequential tasks.

The tutorial itself contains the complete source code of the
application (cfr. `Literate Programming`_ on Wikipedia), so that you
will be able to test/modify it and produce a working ``warholize.py``
script by downloading **pylit** from the `PyLit Homepage`_ and running
the following command on the
``gc3pie/docs/gc3libs/tutorial/warholize.txt`` file, from whitin the
svn tree of GC3Pie::

$    ./pylit warholize.txt warholize.py


Introduction
------------

`Warholize` is a GC3Pie demo application to produce, from a generic
image picture, a new picture like the famous Warhol's work:
`Marylin`_. The script uses the powerful `ImageMagick`_ set of tools
(at least version 6.3.5-7). This tutorial will assume that both
`ImageMagick` and `GC3Pie` are already installed and configured.

In order to produce a similar image we have to do a series of
transformations on the picture:

1) convert the original image to grayscale.

2) `colorize` the grayscale image using three different colors each
   time, based on the gray levels. We may, for instance, make all
   pixels with luminosity between 0-33% in red, pixels
   between 34-66% in yellow and pixels between 67% and 100% in green.

   To do that, we first have to:

   a) create a `Color Lookup Table` (LUT) using a combination of three
      randomly chosen colors

   b) apply the LUT to the grayscale image

3) Finally, we can merge together all the colorized images and produce
   our `warholized` image.

Clearly, step 2) depends on the step 1), and 3) depends on 2), so we
basically have a sequence of tasks, but since step 2) need to create
`N` different independent images, we can parallelize this step.

   Workflow of the `warholize` script

From top to bottom
------------------

We will write our script starting from the top and will descend to the
bottom, from the command line script, to the workflow and finally to
the single execution units which compose the application.


The script
----------

The `SessionBasedScript` class in the `gc3libs.cmdline` module is used
to create a generic script. It already have all what is needed to read
gc3pie configuration files, manage resources, schedule jobs etc. The
only missing thing is, well, your application!

Let's start by creating a new empty file and importing some basic
modules::

  import os
  import gc3libs
  from gc3libs.cmdline import SessionBasedScript
  
we then create a class which inherits from `SessionBasedScript` (in
GC3Pie, most of the customizations are done by inheriting from a more
generic class and overriding the `__init__` method and possibly
others)::

  class WarholizeScript(SessionBasedScript):
      """
      Demo script to create a `Warholized` version of an image.
      """
      version='1.0'
  
Please note that you must either write a small docstring, or add a
`description` attribute. These values are used when the script is
called with options ``--help`` or ``--version``, which are
automatically added by GC3Pie.

The way we want to use our script is straightforward::

$  warholize.py inputfile [inputfiles ...]

and this will create a directory ``Warholized.<inputfile>`` in which
there will be a file called ``warhol_<inputfile>`` containing the
desired warholized image (and a lot of temporary files, at least for now).

But we may want to add some additional options to the script, in order
to decide how many colorized pictures the warholized image will be
made of, or if we want to resize the image. `SessionBasedScript` uses
the `PyCLI`_ module which is, in turn, a wrapper around standard
`argparse`_ (or `optparse`_ for older pythons) module. To customize
the script you may define a `setup_options` method and put in there
some calls to `SessionBasedScript.add_param()`, which is inherited
from `cli.app.CommandLineApp`::

      def setup_options(self):
          self.add_param('--copies', default=4, type=int,
                         help="Number of copyes (Default:4). It has to be a perfect square!")
  
In this example we will accept a ``--copies`` option to define how
many colorized copies the final picture will be made of. Please refer
to the documentation of the `PyCLI`_ module for details on the syntax
of the `add_param` method.

The *heart* of the script is, however, the `new_tasks` method, which
will be called to create the initial tasks of the scripts. In our
case it will be something like::

      def new_tasks(self, extra):
          gc3libs.log.info("Creating main sequential task")
          for (i, input_file) in enumerate(self.params.args):
              kw = extra.copy()
              kw['output_dir'] = 'Warholized.%s' % os.path.basename(input_file)
              yield ("Warholize.%d" % i,
                     WarholizeWorkflow,
                     [input_file,
                      self.params.copies,],
                     kw)
  
`new_tasks` is used as a *generator* (but it could return a list as
well). Each *yielded* object is a tuple which rapresents a generic
Task. In GC3Pie, a task is either a single application or a complex
workflow, and rapresents an *execution unit*. In our case we create a
`WarholizeWorkflow` task which is the workflow described before. We
don't create an instance of the task from whitin `new_tasks`, but we
pass all the arguments needed to create one. In the order:

  * The job name (used to identify the task inside the session)

  * the class object (not the instance!)

  * arguments to be passed to the constructor of the class
  
  * a dictionary containing the keyword arguments to be passed to the
    constructor of the class

In our case we yield a different `WarholizeWorkflow` task for each
input file. These tasks will run in parallel.

Please note that we are using the `gc3libs.log` module to log
informations about the execution. This module works like the
`logging`_ module and has methods like `error`, `warning`, `info` or
`debug`, but its logging level is automatically configured by
`SessionBasedScript`'s constructor.  This way you can increase the
verbosity of your script by simply adding ``-v`` options from the
command line.

The workflows
-------------

Main sequential workflow
++++++++++++++++++++++++

The module `gc3libs.dag` contains two main objects:
`SequentialTaskCollection` and `ParallelTaskCollection`. They execute
tasks in serial and in parallel, respectively. We will use both of
them to create our workflow; the first one, `WarholizeWorkflow`, is a
sequential task, therefore we have to inherit from
`SequentialTaskCollection` and customize its `__init__` method::

  from gc3libs.dag import SequentialTaskCollection, ParallelTaskCollection
  import math
  from gc3libs import Run
  
  class WarholizeWorkflow(SequentialTaskCollection):
      """
      Main workflow.
      """
  
      def __init__(self, input_image,  copies, grid=None, **kw):
          self.input_image = input_image
          self.output_image = "warhol_%s" % os.path.basename(input_image)
  
          gc3libs.log.info(
              "Producing a warholized version of input file %s "
              "and store it in %s" % (input_image, self.output_image))
    
          self.output_dir = os.path.relpath(kw.get('output_dir'))
  
          self.copies = copies
  
          # Check that copies is a perfect square
          if math.sqrt(self.copies) != int(math.sqrt(self.copies)):
              raise gc3libs.exceptions.InvalidArgument(
                  "`copies` argument must be a perfect square.")
  
          self.jobname = kw.get('jobname', 'WarholizedWorkflow')
          self.grayscaled_image = "grayscaled_%s" % os.path.basename(self.input_image)
  
Up to now we just parsed the arguments. The following lines, instead,
create the first task that we want to execute. By now, we can create
only the first one, `GrayScaleConvertApplication`, which will produce
a grayscale image from the input file::

          self.tasks = [
              GrayScaleConvertApplication(
                  self.input_image, self.grayscaled_image, self.output_dir,
                  self.output_dir),
              ]

Finally, we call the parent's constructor.::
  
          SequentialTaskCollection.__init__(
              self, self.jobname, self.tasks, grid=grid)
  

This will create the initial task list, but we have to run also step 2
and 3, and this is done by creating a `next` method. This method will
be called after all the tasks in `self.tasks` are finished. We cannot
create all the jobs at once because we don't have all the needed input
files yet. Please note that by creating the tasks in the `next` method
you could decide *at runtime* which tasks to run next and what
arguments we may want to give to them. 

In our case, however, the `next` method is quite simple::

      def next(self, iteration):
          last = self.tasks[-1]

          if iteration == 0:
              # first time we got called.  We have the grayscaled image,
              # we have to run the Tricolorize task.
              self.add(TricolorizeMultipleImages(
                  os.path.join(self.output_dir, self.grayscaled_image),
                  self.copies, self.output_dir))
              return Run.State.RUNNING
          elif iteration == 1:
              # second time, we already have the colorized images, we
              # have to merge them together.
              self.add(MergeImagesApplication(
                  os.path.join(self.output_dir, self.grayscaled_image),
                  last.warhol_dir,
                  self.output_image))
              return Run.State.RUNNING
          else:
              self.execution.returncode = last.execution.returncode
              return Run.State.TERMINATED
  
At each iteration, we call `self.add()` to add an instance of a
task-like class (`gc3libs.Application`,
`gc3libs.dag.ParallelTaskCollection` or
`gc3libs.dag.SequentialTaskCollection`, in our case) to complete the
next step, and we return the current state, which will be
`gc3libs.Run.State.RUNNING` unless we have finished the computation.


Step one: convert to grayscale
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

`GrayScaleConvertApplication` is the application responsible to
convert to grayscale the input image. The command we want to execute
is::

$    convert -colorspace gray <input_image> grayscaled_<input_image>

To create a generic application we create a class which inherit from
`gc3libs.Application` and we usually only need to customize the
`__init__` method::

  # An useful function to copy files
  from gc3libs.utils import copyfile
  
  class GrayScaleConvertApplication(gc3libs.Application):
      def __init__(self, input_image, grayscaled_image, output_dir, warhol_dir):
          self.warhol_dir = warhol_dir
          self.grayscaled_image = grayscaled_image
  
          arguments = [
              os.path.basename(input_image),
              '-colorspace',
              'gray',
              ]
  
          gc3libs.log.info(
              "Craeting  GrayScale convert application from file %s"
              "to file %s" % (input_image, grayscaled_image))
  
          gc3libs.Application.__init__(
              self,
              executable = 'convert',
              arguments = arguments + [grayscaled_image],
              inputs = [input_image],
              outputs = [grayscaled_image, 'stderr.txt', 'stdout.txt'],
              output_dir = output_dir,
              stdout = 'stdout.txt',
              stderr = 'stderr.txt',
              )
  
Creating a `gc3libs.Application` is straigthforward: you just
call the constructor with the executable, the arguments, and the
input/output files you will need. 

If you don't specify the ``output_dir`` directory, gc3pie libraries will
create one starting from the job name. It is quite important, then, to
generate unique jobname for your applications in order to avoid
conflits. If the output directory exists already, the old one will be
renamed.

To do any kind of post processing you can define a `terminate` method
for your application. It will be called after your application will
terminate. In our case we want to copy the gray scale version of the
image to the `warhol_dir`, so that it will be easily reachable by all
other applications::

      def terminated(self):
          """Move grayscale image to the main output dir"""
          copyfile(
              os.path.join(self.output_dir, self.grayscaled_image),
              self.warhol_dir)

  
Step two: parallel workflow to create colorized images
------------------------------------------------------

The `TricolorizeMultipleImages` is responsible to create multiple
versions of the grayscale image with different coloration chosen
randomly from a list of available colors. It does it by running
multiple instance of `TricolorizeImage` with different
arguments. Since we want to run the various colorization in parallel,
it inherits from `gc3libs.dag.ParallelTaskCollection` class. Like we
did for `GrayScaleConvertApplication`, we only need to customize the
constructor `__init__`, creating the various subtasks we want to run::

  import itertools
  import random
  
  class TricolorizeMultipleImages(ParallelTaskCollection):
      colors = ['yellow', 'blue', 'red', 'pink', 'orchid',
                'indigo', 'navy', 'turquoise1', 'SeaGreen', 'gold',
                'orange', 'magenta']
  
      def __init__(self, grayscaled_image, copies, output_dir, grid=None):
          gc3libs.log.info(
              "TricolorizeMultipleImages for %d copies run" % copies)
          self.jobname = "Warholizer_Parallel"
          ncolors = 3
          ### XXX Why I have to use basename???
          self.output_dir = os.path.join(
              os.path.basename(output_dir), 'tricolorize')
          self.warhol_dir = output_dir
  
          # Compute a unique sequence of random combination of
          # colors. Please note that we can have a maximum of N!/3! if N
          # is len(colors)
          assert copies <= math.factorial(len(self.colors)) / math.factorial(ncolors)
  
          combinations = [i for i in itertools.combinations(self.colors, ncolors)]
          combinations = random.sample(combinations, copies)
  
          # Create all the single tasks
          self.tasks = []
          for i, colors in enumerate(combinations):
              self.tasks.append(TricolorizeImage(
                  os.path.relpath(grayscaled_image),
                  "%s.%d" % (self.output_dir, i),
                  "%s.%d" % (grayscaled_image, i),
                  colors,
                  self.warhol_dir,
                  grid=grid))
  
          ParallelTaskCollection.__init__(self, self.jobname, self.tasks, grid)
  
The main loop will fill the `self.tasks` list with various
`TricolorizedImage` tasks, each one with an unique combination of
three colors to use to generate the colorized image. The GC3Pie
framework will then run these tasks in parallel, on any available
resource.

The `TricolorizedImage` class is indeed a `SequentialTaskCollection`,
since it has to generate the LUT first, and then apply it to the
grayscale image. We already saw how to create a
`SequentialTaskCollection`: we modify the constructor in order to add
the first job (`CreateLutApplication`), and the `next` method will
take care of running the `ApplyLutApplication` application on the
output of the first job::


  class TricolorizeImage(SequentialTaskCollection):
      """
      Sequential workflow to produce a `tricolorized` version of a
      grayscale image
      """
      def __init__(self, grayscaled_image, output_dir, output_file,
                   colors, warhol_dir, grid=None):
          self.grayscaled_image = grayscaled_image
          self.output_dir = output_dir
          self.warhol_dir = warhol_dir
          self.jobname = 'TricolorizeImage'
          self.output_file = output_file
  
          if not os.path.isdir(output_dir):
              os.mkdir(output_dir)
  
          gc3libs.log.info(
              "Tricolorize image %s to %s" % (
                  self.grayscaled_image, self.output_file))
  
          self.tasks = [
              CreateLutApplication(
                  self.grayscaled_image,
                  "%s.miff" % self.grayscaled_image,
                  self.output_dir,
                  colors, self.warhol_dir),
              ]
  
          SequentialTaskCollection.__init__(self, self.jobname, self.tasks, grid)
  
      def next(self, iteration):
          last = self.tasks[-1]
          if iteration == 0:
              # First time we got called. The LUT has been created, we
              # have to apply it to the grayscale image
              self.add(ApplyLutApplication(
                  self.grayscaled_image,
                  os.path.join(last.output_dir, last.lutfile),
                  os.path.basename(self.output_file),
                  self.output_dir, self.warhol_dir))
              return Run.State.RUNNING
          else:
              self.execution.returncode = last.execution.returncode
              return Run.State.TERMINATED

The `CreateLutApplication` is again an application which inherits from
`gc3libs.Application`. The command we want to execute is something
like::

$    convert -size 1x1 xc:<color1> xc:<color2> xc:<color3> +append -resize 256x1! <output_file.miff>

This will basically create an image 256x1 pixels big, made of a
gradient using all the listed colors. The code will look like::

  class CreateLutApplication(gc3libs.Application):
      """Create the LUT for the image using 3 colors picked randomly
      from CreateLutApplication.colors"""
  
      def __init__(self, input_image, output_file, output_dir, colors, working_dir):
          self.lutfile = os.path.basename(output_file)
          self.working_dir = working_dir
          gc3libs.log.info("Creating lut file %s from %s using "
                           "colors: %s" % (
              self.lutfile, input_image, str.join(", ", colors)))
          gc3libs.Application.__init__(
              self,
              executable = "convert",
              arguments = [
                  '-size',
                  '1x1'] + [
                  "xc:%s" % color for color in colors] + [
                  '+append',
                  '-resize',
                  '256x1!',
                  self.lutfile,
                  ],
              inputs = [input_image],
              outputs = [self.lutfile, 'stdout.txt', 'stderr.txt'],
              output_dir = output_dir + '.createlut',
              stdout = 'stdout.txt',
              stderr = 'stderr.txt',
              )
  
Similarly, the  `ApplyLutApplication` application will run the
following command::

$    convert grayscaled_<input_image> <lutfile.N.miff> -clut grayscaled_<input_image>.<N>

This command will apply the LUT to the grayscaled image: it will
modify the grayscaled image by `coloring` a generic pixel with a
luminosity value of `n` (which will be an integer value from 0 to 255,
of course) with the color at position `n` in the LUT image (actually,
`n+1`). Each `ApplyLutApplication` will save the resulting image to a
file named as ``grayscaled_<input_image>.<N>``.

The class will look like::

  class ApplyLutApplication(gc3libs.Application):
      """Apply the LUT computed by `CreateLutApplication` to
      `image_file`"""
  
      def __init__(self, input_image, lutfile, output_file, output_dir, working_dir):
  
          gc3libs.log.info("Applying lut file %s to %s" % (lutfile, input_image))
          self.working_dir = working_dir
          self.output_file = output_file
  
          gc3libs.Application.__init__(
              self,
              executable = "convert",
              arguments = [
                  os.path.basename(input_image),
                  os.path.basename(lutfile),
                  '-clut',
                  output_file,
                  ],
              inputs = [input_image, lutfile],
              outputs = [output_file, 'stdout.txt', 'stderr.txt'],
              output_dir = output_dir + '.applylut',
              stdout = 'stdout.txt',
              stderr = 'stderr.txt',
              )
  
The `terminated` method::

      def terminated(self):
          """Copy colorized image to the output dir"""
          copyfile(
              os.path.join(self.output_dir, self.output_file),
              self.working_dir)
  
will copy the colorized image file in the top level directory,
so that it will be easier for the last application to find all the
needed files.


Step three: merge all them together
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

At this point we will have in the main output directory a bunch of
files named after ``grayscaled_<input_image>.N`` with N a sequential
integer and ``<input_image>`` the name of the original image. The last
application, `MergeImagesApplication`, will produce a
``warhol_<input_image>`` image by merging all of them using the
command::

$    montage grayscaled_<input_image>.* -tile 3x3 -geometry +5+5 -background white warholized_<input_image>

Now it should be easy to write such application::

  import re
  
  class MergeImagesApplication(gc3libs.Application):
      def __init__(self, grayscaled_image, input_dir, output_file):
          ifile_regexp = re.compile(
              "%s.[0-9]+" % os.path.basename(grayscaled_image))
          input_files = [
              os.path.join(input_dir, fname) for fname in os.listdir(input_dir)
              if ifile_regexp.match(fname)]
          input_filenames = [os.path.basename(i) for i in input_files]
          gc3libs.log.info("MergeImages initialized")
          self.input_dir = input_dir
          self.output_file = output_file
  
          tile = math.sqrt(len(input_files))
          if tile != int(tile):
              gc3libs.log.error(
                  "We would expect to have a perfect square"
                  "of images to merge, but we have %d instead" % len(input_files))
              raise gc3libs.exceptions.InvalidArgument(
                  "We would expect to have a perfect square of images to merge, but we have %d instead" % len(input_files))
  
          gc3libs.Application.__init__(
              self,
              executable = 'montage',
              arguments = input_filenames + [
                  '-tile',
                  '%dx%d' % (tile, tile),
                  '-geometry',
                  '+5+5',
                  '-background',
                  'white',
                  output_file,
                  ],
              inputs = input_files,
              outputs = [output_file, 'stderr.txt', 'stdout.txt'],
              output_dir = os.path.join(input_dir, 'output'),
              stdout = 'stdout.txt',
              stderr = 'stderr.txt',
              )
  
  
Making the script executable
----------------------------

Finally, in order to make the script *executable*, we add the
following lines to the end of the file. The `WarholizeScritp().run()`
call will be executed only when the file is run as a script, and will
do all the magic related to argument parsing, creating the session
etc...::

  if __name__ == '__main__':
      import warholize
      warholize.WarholizeScript().run()
  
Please note that the ``import warholize`` statement is important to
address `issue 95`_ and make the gc3pie scripts work with your current
session (`gstat`, `ginfo`...)
  
Testing
-------

To test this script I would suggest to use the famous `Lena` picture,
which can be found in the `miscelaneous` section of the `Signal and
Image Processing Institute`_ page. Download the image, rename it as
``lena.tiff`` and run the following command::

$    ./warholize.py -C 1 lena.tiff --copies 9

(add ``-r localhost`` if your gc3pie.conf script support it and you
want to test it locally). 

After completion a file ``Warholized.lena.tiff/output/warhol_lena.tiff``
will be created.

The ``data/`` directory contains test data provided by the ZODS
project.

Testing ``gzods``
===================

The ``gzods`` application will scan its arguments for files with the
``input*.xml`` extension.  The auxliary files are located
by parsing the ``input*.xml`` file.

Therefore, to run a test of ``gzods`` it is sufficient to provide
the path to a directory containing some ``input.xml`` files.  Two such
directories are provided here:

* ``data/small``: a directory containing 3 files, resulting in a
  single ZODS job being submitted.  The whole job runs for about 5
  minutes.
* ``data/large``: this contains 6 different
  directories, 6 ZODS jobs should be
  submitted when this directory is fed to ``gzods`` as input.

Invocation of ``gzods`` follows the usual session-based script
conventions::

    gzods -s TEST_SESSION_NAME -C 120 -vvv data/small

Like all session-based scripts, ``gzods`` starts with a status
report like this one::

    Status of jobs in the 'XXX' session: (at 13:08:08, 02/28/12)
            NEW   0/1    (0.0%)  
        RUNNING   0/1    (0.0%)  
        STOPPED   0/1    (0.0%)  
      SUBMITTED   1/1   (100.0%) 
     TERMINATED   0/1    (0.0%)  
    TERMINATING   0/1    (0.0%)  
          total   1/1   (100.0%) 

See above for the number of jobs generated by each directory.
 
The processing ends when TERMINATED has reached 100% jobs.

When all the jobs are done, each input *directory* will contain
an ``.out`` directory, with the following content:

* An ``.pdb`` or other ZODS output files
* Files ``stdout.txt`` and ``stderr.txt`` with the
  obvious meanings.

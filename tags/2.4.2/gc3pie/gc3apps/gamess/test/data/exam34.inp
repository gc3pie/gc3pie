! EXAM34.
!   CIS treatment of excited states of formaldehyde.
!
!   EXCITED STATE 1's E=-113.7017742428, RMS=0.0290048
!   The S0->S1 transition dipole is (0,0,0.006029),
!   and the S0 -> S1 transition energy is 4.56 eV.
!
!   geometry optimization would lead in 18 steps to 
!   -113.7053624528, at r(CO)=1.2553, r(CH)=1.0854, 
!   a(HCO)= 117.74, with C's pyramidalization= 24.88.
!   This reproduces the fourth line of Table III in 
!   Foresman et al. J.Phys.Chem. 96, 135-149(1992),
!   using no frozen core orbitals in order to do so.
!   Since it is well known that the geometry of this
!   state lies within Cs symmetry, the initial guess
!   geometry below is very slightly bent into Cs.

## the main script

class GGamessScript(SessionBasedScript):
    """
Scan the specified INPUT directories recursively for '.inp' files,
and submit a GAMESS job for each input file found; job progress is
monitored and, when a job is done, its '.out' and '.dat' file are
retrieved back into the same directory where the '.inp' file is (this
can be overridden with the '-o' option).

The `ggamess` command keeps a record of jobs (submitted, executed and
pending) in a session file (set name with the '-s' option); at each
invocation of the command, the status of all recorded jobs is updated,
output from finished jobs is collected, and a summary table of all
known jobs is printed.  New jobs are added to the session if new input
files are added to the command line.

Options can specify a maximum number of jobs that should be in
'SUBMITTED' or 'RUNNING' state; `ggamess` will delay submission
of newly-created jobs so that this limit is never exceeded.

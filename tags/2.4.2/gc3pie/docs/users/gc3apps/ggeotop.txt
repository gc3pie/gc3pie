The `ggeotop`:command: script
=============================

GC3Apps provide a script drive execution of multiple ``GEOtop``
jobs. It uses the generic `gc3libs.cmdline.SessionBasedScript`
framework.

From GEOtop's "read me" file::

    #
    # RUNNING
    # Run this simulation by calling the executable (GEOtop_1.223_static) 
    # and giving the simulation directory as an argument.
    # 
    # EXAMPLE
    # ls2:/group/geotop/sim/tmp/000001>./GEOtop_1.223_static ./
    # 
    # TERMINATION OF SIMULATION BY GEOTOP
    # When GEOtop terminates due to an internal error, it mostly reports this
    # by writing a corresponding file (_FAILED_RUN or _FAILED_RUN.old) in the
    # simulation directory. When is terminates sucessfully this file is
    # named (_SUCCESSFUL_RUN or _SUCCESSFUL_RUN.old).
    # 
    # RESTARTING SIMULATIONS THAT WERE TERMINATED BY THE SERVER
    # When a simulation is started again with the same arguments as described
    # above (RUNNING), then it continues from the last saving point. If
    # GEOtop finds a file indicating a successful/failed run, it terminates.


Introduction
------------

`ggeotop`:command: driver script acan the specified INPUT directories
recursively for simulation directories and submit a job for each one
found; job progress is monitored and, when a job is done, its output
files are retrieved back into the simulation directory itself.

A simulation directory is defined as a directory containing a
``geotop.inpts`` file, an ``in`` and an ``out`` folders.

The ``ggeotop`` command keeps a record of jobs (submitted, executed
and pending) in a session file (set name with the ``-s`` option); at
each invocation of the command, the status of all recorded jobs is
updated, output from finished jobs is collected, and a summary table
of all known jobs is printed.  New jobs are added to the session if
new input files are added to the command line.

Options can specify a maximum number of jobs that should be in
'SUBMITTED' or 'RUNNING' state; ``ggeotop`` will delay submission of
newly-created jobs so that this limit is never exceeded.

Options can specify a maximum number of jobs that should be in
'SUBMITTED' or 'RUNNING' state; `ggeotop`:command: will delay submission
of newly-created jobs so that this limit is never exceeded.

In more detail, `ggeotop`:command: does the following:
   
1. Reads the `session`:term: (specified on the command line with the
   ``--session`` option) and loads all stored jobs into memory.
   If the session directory does not exist, one will be created with
   empty contents.
   
2. Recursively scans trough ``input`` folder searching for any valid
   folder.
   
   `ggeotop`:command: will generate a collection of jobs one for each
   valid input folder. Each job will transfer the input folder to the
   remote execution node and run ``GEOTop``. 
   ``GEOTop`` reads geotop.inpts files for getting instructions on how
   to find the input data, what and how to process and where to place
   generated output results. Extracted from a generic geotop.inpts
   file:

::

   DemFile = "in/dem"
   MeteoFile = "in/meteo"
   SkyViewFactorMapFile = "in/svf"
   SlopeMapFile = "in/slp"
   AspectMapFile = "in/asp"
   
   !==============================================
   !   DIST OUTPUT
   !==============================================
   SoilAveragedTempTensorFile = "out/maps/T"
   NetShortwaveRadiationMapFile="out/maps/SWnet"
   InShortwaveRadiationMapFile="out/maps/SWin"
   InLongwaveRadiationMapFile="out/maps/LWin"
   SWEMapFile= "out/maps/SWE" 
   AirTempMapFile = "out/maps/Ta"
   

3. Updates the state of all existing jobs, collects output from
   finished jobs, and submits new jobs generated in step 2.

4. For each of the terminated jobs, a post-process routine is executed
   to check and validate the consistency of the generated output. If
   no ``_SUCCESSFUL_RUN`` or ``_FAILED_RUN`` file is found, the
   related job will be resubmitted together with the current input and
   output folders. GEOTop is capable of restarting an interrupted
   claculation by inspecting the intermediate results generated in
   ``out`` folder.

   Finally, a summary table of all known jobs is printed.  (To control
   the amount of printed information, see the ``-l`` command-line
   option in the `session-based script`:ref: section.)

4. If the ``-C`` command-line option was given (see below), waits
   the specified amount of seconds, and then goes back to step 3.

   The program `ggeotop`:command: exits when all jobs have run to
   completion, i.e., when all valid input folders have been computed.

Execution can be interrupted at any time by pressing :kbd:`Ctrl+C`.
If the execution has been interrupted, it can be resumed at a later
stage by calling `ggeotop`:command: with exactly the same
command-line options.

Command-line invocation of `ggeotop`:command:
----------------------------------------------

The `ggeotop`:command: script is based on GC3Pie's `session-based
script <session-based script>`:ref: model; please read also the
`session-based script`:ref: section for an introduction to sessions
and generic command-line options.

A `ggeotop`:command: command-line is constructed as follows:

1. Each argument (at least one should be specified) is considered as a
   folder reference.
2. ``-x`` option is used to specify the path to the GEOtop executable
   file.

**Example 1.** The following command-line invocation uses
`ggeotop`:command: to run ``GEOTop`` on all valid input folder found
in the recursive check of ``input_folder``::

   $ ggeotop -x /apps/geotop/bin/geotop_1_224_20120227_static ./input_folder

**Example 2.**
::
   
   $ ggeotop --session SAMPLE_SESSION -w 24 -x /apps/geotop/bin/geotop_1_224_20120227_static ./input_folder

In this example, job information is stored into session
``SAMPLE_SESSION`` (see the documentation of the ``--session`` option
in `session-based script`:ref:).  The command above creates the jobs,
submits them, and finally prints the following status report::

  Status of jobs in the 'SAMPLE_SESSION' session: (at 10:53:46, 02/28/12)
  NEW   0/50    (0.0%)  
  RUNNING   0/50    (0.0%)  
  STOPPED   0/50    (0.0%)  
  SUBMITTED   50/50   (100.0%) 
  TERMINATED   0/50    (0.0%)  
  TERMINATING   0/50    (0.0%)  
  total   50/50   (100.0%) 

Calling `ggeotop`:command: over and over again will result in the same jobs
being monitored; 

The ``-C`` option tells `ggeotop`:command: to continue running until
all jobs have finished running and the output files have been
correctly retrieved.  On successful completion, the command given in
*example 2.* above, would print::

  Status of jobs in the 'SAMPLE_SESSION' session: (at 11:05:50, 02/28/12)
  NEW   0/50    (0.0%)  
  RUNNING   0/50    (0.0%)  
  STOPPED   0/540    (0.0%)  
  SUBMITTED   0/50    (0.0%)  
  TERMINATED   50/50   (100.0%) 
  TERMINATING   0/50    (0.0%)  
  ok   50/50   (100.0%) 
  total   50/50   (100.0%) 

Each job will be named after the folder name (e.g. 000002) (you could
see this by passing the ``-l`` option to `ggeotop`:command:).; each of
these jobs will fill the related input folder with the produced
outputs.

For each job, the set of output files is automatically retrieved and
placed in the locations described below.  

Output files for `ggeotop`:command:
------------------------------------

Upon successful completion, the output directory of each
`ggeotop`:command: job contains:

* the ``out`` folder will contains what has been produced during the
  computation of the related job.


Example usage
-------------

This section contains commented example sessions with
`ggeotop`:command:.

Manage a set of jobs from start to end
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*In typical operation,* one calls `ggeotop`:command: with the ``-C``
option and lets it manage a set of jobs until completion.

So, to analyse all valid folders under ``input_folder``, submitting
200 jobs simultaneously each of them requesting 2GB of memory and 8
hours of `wall-clock time <walltime>`:term:, one can use the following
command-line invocation::
  
  $ ggeotop -s example -C 120 -x
  /apps/geotop/bin/geotop_1_224_20120227_static -w 8 input_folder

The ``-s example`` option tells `ggeotop`:command: to store
information about the computational jobs in the ``example.jobs``
directory.

The ``-C 120`` option tells `ggeotop`:command: to update job state
every 120 seconds; output from finished jobs is retrieved and new jobs
are submitted at the same interval.

The above command will start by printing a status report like the
following:
::

   Status of jobs in the 'example.csv' session:
   SUBMITTED   1/1 (100.0%)
   
It will continue printing an updated status report every 120 seconds
until the requested parameter range has been computed.

In GC3Pie terminology when a job is finished and its output has been
successfully retrieved, the job is marked as ``TERMINATED``::

  Status of jobs in the 'example.csv' session:
  TERMINATED   1/1 (100.0%)

Using GC3Pie utilities
----------------------

GC3Pie comes with a set of generic utilities that could be used as a
complemet to the `ggeotop`:command: command to better manage a entire
session execution.

:command:`gkill`: cancel a running job
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To cancel a running job, you can use the command :command:`gkill`.  For
instance, to cancel *job.16*, you would type the following command
into the terminal::

  gkill job.16

or::

  gkill -s example job.16

gkill could also be used to cancel jobs in  a given state
::

  gkill -s example -l UNKNOWN

.. warning:: 

   *There's no way to undo a cancel operation!* Once you have issued a
   :command:`gkill` command, the job is deleted and it cannot be resumed.
   (You can still re-submit it with :command:`gresub`, though.)


:command:`ginfo`: accessing low-level details of a job
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is sometimes necessary, for debugging purposes, to print out all
the details about a job; the :command:`ginfo` command does just that: prints
all the details that GC3Utils know about a single job.

For instance, to print out detailed information about `job.13` in
session `example`, you would type
::

    ginfo -s example job.13

For a job in ``RUNNING`` or ``SUBMITTED`` state, only little
information is known: basically, where the job is running, and when it
was started::

    $ ginfo -s example job.13
    job.13
        cores: 2
	execution_targets: hera.wsl.ch
	log: 
            SUBMITTED at Tue May 15 09:52:05 2012
	    Submitted to 'wsl' at Tue May 15 09:52:05 2012
	    RUNNING at Tue May 15 10:07:39 2012
	lrms_jobid: gsiftp://hera.wsl.ch:2811/jobs/116613370683251353308673
	lrms_jobname: GC3Pie_00002
	original_exitcode: -1
	queue: smscg.q
	resource_name: wsl
	state_last_changed: 1337069259.18
	stderr_filename: ggeotop.log
	stdout_filename: ggeotop.log
	timestamp: 
	    RUNNING: 1337069259.18
	    SUBMITTED: 1337068325.26
	unknown_iteration: 0
	used_cputime: 1380
	used_memory: 3382706

If you omit the job number, information about *all* jobs in the
session will be printed.

Most of the output is only useful if you are familiar with GC3Utils
inner working. Nonetheless, :command:`ginfo` output is definitely something
you should include in any report about a misbehaving job!

For a finished job, the information is more complete and can include
error messages in case the job has failed::

  $ ginfo -c -s example job.13
  job.13
      _arc0_state_last_checked: 1337069259.18
      _exitcode: 0
      _signal: None
      _state: TERMINATED

      unknown_iteration: 0
      used_cputime: 360
      used_memory: 3366977
      used_walltime: 300

With option ``-v``, :command:`ginfo` output is even more verbose and complete,
and includes information about the application itself, the input and
output files, plus some backend-specific information
::

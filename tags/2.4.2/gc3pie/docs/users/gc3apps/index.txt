-----------------------
 The GC3Apps software
-----------------------

GC3Apps is a collection command line front-end to manage submission of
a (potentially) large number of computational :term:`job` to different
batch processing systems.  For example, the GC3Apps commands
`ggamess`:command: can run GAMESS_ jobs on the SMSCG_ infrastructure
and on any computational cluster you can ``ssh``:command: into.

This chapter is a tutorial for the GC3Apps command-line scripts: it
explains the common concepts and features, then goes on to describe
the specifics of each command in larger detail.

All GC3Apps scripts share a common set of functionalities, which are
derive from a common blueprint, named a *session-based script*,
described in Section `session-based script`:ref: below.  Script-specific
sections detail the scope and options that are unique to a given
script.

If you find a technical term whose meaning is not clear to you, please
look it up in the :ref:`glossary`. (But feel free to ask on the
`GC3Pie mailing list`_ if it's still unclear!)

Configuration File
==================


Location
--------

All commands in `GC3Apps`:ref: and `GC3Utils`:ref: read two
configuration files at startup:

  * system-wide one located at :file:``/etc/gc3/gc3pie.conf``, and
  * a user-private one at :file:``~/.gc3/gc3pie.conf``.

Both files are optional, but at least one of them must exist.

Both files use the same format. The system-wide one is read first, so
that users can override the system-level configuration in their private file.
Configuration data from corresponding sections in the two
configuration files is merged; the value in the user-private file
overrides the one from the system-wide configuration.

If you try to start any GC3Utils command without having a
configuration file, a sample one will be copied to the user-private
location :file:``~/.gc3/gc3pie.conf`` and an error message will be
displayed, directing you to edit the sample file before retrying.


Configuration file format
-------------------------

The GC3Pie configuration file follows the format understood by
`Python ConfigParser <http://docs.python.org/library/configparser.html>`_,
which is very close to the syntax used in MS-Windows ``.INI`` files.
See http://docs.python.org/library/configparser.html for reference.

The GC3Libs configuration file consists of several configuration
blocks.  Each configuration block (section) starts with a keyword in
square brackets and contains the configuration options for a specific
part.

The following sections are used by the GC3Apps/GC3Utils programs:

  - ``[DEFAULT]`` -- this is for global settings.
  - `[auth/{name}]`:file: -- these are for settings related to identity/authentication (identifying yourself to clusters & grids).
  - `[resource/{name}]`:file: -- these are for settings related to a specific computing resource (cluster, grid, etc.)

Sections with other names are allowed but will be ignored.


The ``DEFAULT`` section
-----------------------

The ``[DEFAULT]`` section is optional.

Values defined in the ``[DEFAULT]`` section can be used to insert
values in other sections, using the ``%(name)s`` syntax.  See
documentation of the `Python SafeConfigParser
<http://docs.python.org/library/configparser.html>`_ object at
http://docs.python.org/library/configparser.html for an example.


``auth`` sections
-----------------

There can be more than one ``[auth]`` section.

Each authentication section must begin with a line of the form:

    `[auth/{name}]`:file:

where the `{name}`:file: portion is any alphanumeric string.

You can have as many `[auth/{name}]`:file: sections as you want; any
name is allowed provided it's composed only of letters, numbers and
the underscore character ``_``.

This allows you to define different auth methods for different
resources.  Each `[resource/{name}]`:file: section will reference one
(and one only) authentication section.


Authentication types
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each ``auth`` section *must* specify a ``type`` setting.

``type`` defines the authentication type that will be used to access
a resource. There are three supported authentication types:

  * ``ssh``; use this for resources that will be accessed by opening an SSH connection to the front-end node of a cluster.
  * ``voms-proxy``: uses ``voms-proxy-init`` to generate a proxy; use for resources that require a VOMS-enabled Grid proxy.
  * ``grid-proxy``: uses ``grid-proxy-init`` to generate a proxy; use for resources that require a Grid proxy (but no VOMS extensions).
  * ``ec2``: use this for a EC2-compatible cloud resource.

For the ``ssh``-type auth, the following keys must be provided:

  * ``type``: must be ``ssh``
  * ``username``: must be the username to log in as on the remote machine

The following configuration keys are instead optional:

  * ``port``: TCP port number where the SSH server is listening.  The
    default value 22 is fine for almost all cases; change it only if
    you know what you are doing.
  * ``keyfile``: path to the (private) key file to use for SSH public
    key authentication.
  * ``ssh_config``: path to a SSH configuration file, where to read
    additional options from (default: ``$HOME/ssh/config``:file:.  The
    format of the SSH configuration file is documented in the
    `ssh_config(5)`__ man page.
  * ``timeout``: maximum amount of time (in seconds) that GC3Pie will
    wait for the SSH connection to be established.

.. __: http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi/OpenBSD-current/man5/ssh_config.5?query=ssh_config&sec=5

.. note::

  We advise you to use the SSH config file for setting port, key file,
  and connection timeout.  Options ``port``, ``keyfile``, and
  ``timeout`` could be deprecated in future releases.

For the ``ec2``-type auth, the following keys *can* be provided. If
they are not found, the value of the corresponding environment
variable will be used instead, if found, otherwise an error will be
raised.

  * ``ec2_access_key``: Your personal access key to authenticate
    against the specific cloud endpoint. If not found, the environment
    variable ``EC2_ACCESS_KEY`` will be used.

  * ``ec2_secret_key``: Your personal secret key associated with the
    above ``ec2_access_key``. If not found, the environment
    variable ``EC2_SECRET_KEY`` will be used.

Any other key/value pair will be ignored.

For the ``voms-proxy`` type auth, the following keys must be provided:

  * ``type``: must be ``voms-proxy``
  * ``vo``: the VO to authenticate with (passed directly to
    ``voms-proxy-init`` as argument to the ``--vo`` command-line
    switch)
  * ``cert_renewal_method``: see below.
  * ``remember_password``: see below.

Any other key/value pair will be ignored.

For the ``grid-proxy`` type auth, the following keys must be provided:

  * ``type``: must be ``grid-proxy``
  * ``cert_renewal_method``: see below.
  * ``remember_password``: see below.

Any other key/value pair will be ignored.

For the ``voms-proxy`` and ``grid-proxy`` authentication types, the
``cert_renewal_method`` setting specifies whether GC3Libs should attempt
to get a certificate if the current one is expired or otherwise invalid.
Currently there are two supported ``cert_renewal_method`` types:

  * ``slcs``: user certificate is generated through an invocation of the ``slcs-init``:command: program.
  * ``manual``: user certificate is generated/renewed though an
    external process and has to be performed by the user outside of
    the scope of GC3Pie. In this case, if the user certificate is expired,
    invalid or non-existent, GC3Pie will fail to authenticate.

For the ``slcs`` certificate renewal method, the  following keys must be provided:

  * ``aai_username``: passed directly to `slcs-init`:command: as argument to the ``--user`` command-line switch.
  * ``idp``: passed directly to `slcs-init`:command: as argument to the ``--idp`` command-line switch.

For the ``manual`` certificate renewal method, no additional keys are required.

The ``remember_password`` entry (optional) must be set to a boolean
value (the strings ``1`, ``yes``, ``true`` and ``on`` are interpreted
as boolean "true"; any other value counts as "false").  If set to a
true value, the ``remember_password`` entry instructs GC3Pie to keep
the password used for this authentication in the program's main
memory; this implies that you will be asked for the password at most
once per program invocation.  This setting is optional, and defaults
to "false". Keeping passwords in memory is bad security practice; do
not set this option to "true" unless you understand the implications.

*Example 1.* The following example ``auth`` section shows how to
configure GC3Pie for using SWITCHaai_ SLCS_ services to generate a
certificate and a VOMS_ proxy to access the Swiss National Distributed
Computing Infrastructure SMSCG_::

    [auth/smscg]
    type = voms-proxy
    cert_renewal_method = slcs
    aai_username = <aai_user_name> # SWITCHaai/Shibboleth user name
    idp= uzh.ch
    vo = smscg

*Example 2.* The following configuration sections are used to set up
two different accounts, that GC3Pie programs can use.  Which account
should be used on which computational resource is defined in the
`resource sections`_ (see below). ::

    [auth/ssh1]
    type = ssh
    username = murri # your username here

    [auth/ssh2] # I use a different account name on some resources
    type = ssh
    username = rmurri
    # read additional options from this SSH config file
    ssh_config = ~/.ssh/alt-config

*Example 3.* The following configuration section is used to access an
EC2 resource (access and
secret keys are of course invalid :))::

    [auth/hobbes]
    type=ec2
    ec2_access_key=1234567890qwertyuiopasdfghjklzxc
    ec2_secret_key=cxzlkjhgfdsapoiuytrewq0987654321

``resource`` sections
---------------------

Each resource section must begin with a line of the form:

    `[resource/{name}]`:file:

You can have as many :file:`[resource/{name}]` sections as you want; this
allows you to define many different resources.  Each `[resource/{name}]`:file:
section must reference one (and one only) `[auth/{name}]`:file:
section (by its ``auth`` key).

Resources currently come in several flavours, distinguished by the
value of the ``type`` key:

  * If ``type`` is ``sge``, then the resource is a `Grid Engine`_ batch system, to be accessed by an SSH connection to its front-end node.
  * If ``type`` is ``pbs``, then the resource is a `Torque/PBS`_ batch system, to be accessed by an SSH connection to its front-end node.
  * If ``type`` is ``lsf``, then the resource is a `LSF`_ batch system, to be accessed by an SSH connection to its front-end node.
  * If ``type`` is ``slurm``, then the resource is a `SLURM`_ batch system, to be accessed by an SSH connection to its front-end node.
  * If ``type`` is ``shellcmd``, then the resource is the computer
    where the GC3Pie script is running and applications are executed
    by just spawning a local UNIX process.
  * If ``type`` is ``ec2+shellcmd``, then the resource is a cloud with
    EC2-compatible APIs, and applications are run on Virtual Machines
    spawned on the cloud.

All `[resource/{name}]`:file: sections (except those of ``shellcmd``
type) *must* reference a valid ``auth/***`` section. Resources of
``sge``, ``pbs``, ``lsf`` and ``slurm`` type can only reference
:command:``ssh`` type sections.

Some configuration keys are commmon to all resource types:

  *  ``type``: Resource type, see above.
  *  ``auth``: the name of a valid `[auth/{name}]`:file: section; only
     the authentication section name (after the ``/``) must be
     specified.
  *  ``max_cores_per_job``: Maximum number of CPU cores that a job can request; a resource will be dropped during the brokering process if a job requests more cores than this.
  *  ``max_memory_per_core``: Max amount of memory (expressed in GBs) that a job can request.
  *  ``max_walltime``: Maximum job running time (in hours).
  *  ``max_cores``: Total number of cores provided by the resource.
  *  ``architecture``: Processor architecture.  Should be one of the strings ``x86_64`` (for 64-bit Intel/AMD/VIA processors), ``i686`` (for 32-bit Intel/AMD/VIA x86 processors), or ``x86_64,i686`` if both architectures are available on the resource.
  *  ``time_cmd``: Used only when ``type`` is ``shellcmd``. The `time` program is used as wrapper for the application in order to collect informations about the execution when running without a real `LRMS`.

  * ``prologue``: Used only when ``type`` is ``pbs``, ``lsf``,
     ``slurm`` or ``sge``. The content of the `prologue` script will be
     *inserted* into the submission script and it's executed before
     the real application.  It is intended to execute some shell
     commands needed to setup the execution environment before running
     the application (e.g. running a `module load ...` command). The
     script **must** be a valid, plain `/bin/sh` script.

  * ``<application_name>_prologue``: Same as ``prologue``, but it is
    used only when ``<application_name>`` matches the name of the
    application. Valid application names are: `zods`, `gamess`,
    `turbomole`, `codeml`, `rosetta`, `rosetta_docking`, `geotop`. If
    both ``prologue`` and ``<application_name>_prologue`` options are
    defined, the content of both files is included in the submission
    script (first ``prologue``, then ``<application_name>_prologue``).

  * ``prologue_content``: Used only when ``type`` is ``pbs``, ``lsf``,
     ``slurm`` or ``sge``. A (possibly multi-line) string that will be
     *inserted* into the submission script and executed before the
     real application. Its value will be inserted after *any* other
     ``prologue``, ``<application_name>_prologue`` option, if present.

  * ``<application_name>_prologue_content``: Same as
    ``prologue_content``, but it is used only when
    ``<application_name>`` matches the name of the application. Valid
    application names are: `zods`, `gamess`, `turbomole`, `codeml`,
    `rosetta`, `rosetta_docking`, `geotop`. Its value will be inserted
    after *any* other ``prologue``, ``<application_name>_prologue``,
    ``prologue_content`` option, if present.

  * ``epilogue``: Used only when ``type`` is ``pbs``, ``lsf``,
     ``slurm`` or ``sge``. The content of the `epilogue` script will
     be *inserted* into the submission script and it's executed after
     the real application. The script **must** be a valid, plain
     `/bin/sh` script.

  * ``<application_name>_epilogue``: Same as ``epilogue``, but it is
    used only when ``<application_name>`` matches the name of the
    application. Valid application names are: `zods`, `gamess`,
    `turbomole`, `codeml`, `rosetta`, `rosetta_docking`, `geotop`.  If
    both ``epilogue`` and ``<application_name>_epilogue`` options are
    defined, the content of both files is included in the submission
    script (first ``epilogue``, then ``<application_name>_epilogue``).

  * ``epilogue_content``: Used only when ``type`` is ``pbs``, ``lsf``,
     ``slurm`` or ``sge``. A (possibly multi-line) string that will be
     *inserted* into the submission script and executed after the real
     application. Its value will be inserted after *any* other
     ``epilogue``, ``<application_name>_epilogue`` option, if present.

  * ``<application_name>_epilogue_content``: Same as
    ``epilogue_content``, but it is used only when
    ``<application_name>`` matches the name of the application. Valid
    application names are: `zods`, `gamess`, `turbomole`, `codeml`,
    `rosetta`, `rosetta_docking`, `geotop`. Its value will be inserted
    after *any* other ``epilogue``, ``<application_name>_epilogue``,
    ``epilogue_content`` option, if present.

``sge`` resources
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following configuration keys are required in a ``sge``-type resource section:

  * ``frontend``: should contain the `FQDN (Fully-qualified domain name)`:abbr: of the SGE front-end node. An SSH connection will be attempted to this node, in order to submit jobs and retrieve status info.
  * ``transport``: Possible values are: ``ssh`` or ``local``.   If ``ssh``, we try to connect to the host specified in ``frontend`` via SSH in order to execute SGE commands.  If ``local``, the SGE commands are run directly on the machine where GC3Pie is installed.

To submit parallel jobs to SGE, a "parallel environment" name must be
specified.  You can specify the PE to be used with a specific
application using a configuration parameter *application name* +
``_pe`` (e.g., ``gamess_pe``, ``zods_pe``); the ``default_pe``
parameter dictates the parallel environment to use if no
application-specific one is defined.  *If neither the
application-specific, nor the ``default_pe`` parallel environments are
defined, then it will not be possible to submit parallel jobs.*

When a job has finished, the SGE batch system does not (by default)
immediately write its information into the accounting database.  This
creates a time window during which no information is reported about
the job by SGE, as if it never existed.  In order not to mistake this
for a "job lost" error, GC3Libs allow a "grace time": `qacct`:command:
job information lookups are allowed to fail for a certain time span
after the first time `qstat`:command: failed. The duration of this
time span is set with the ``sge_accounting_delay`` parameter, whose
default is 15 seconds (matches the default in SGE, as of release 6.2):

  * ``sge_accounting_delay``: Time (in seconds) a failure in `qacct`:command: will *not* be considered critical.

GC3Pie uses standard command line utilities to interact with the
resource manager. By default these commands are searched using the
``PATH`` environment variable, but you can specify the full path of
these commands and/or add some extra options. The following options
are used by the SGE backend:

  * ``qsub``: submit a job.

  * ``qacct``: get info on resources used by a job.

  * ``qdel``: cancel a job.

  * ``qstat``: get the status of a job or the status of available
    resources.

If ``transport`` is ``ssh``, then the following options are also read
and take precedence above the corresponding options set in the "auth"
section:

  * ``port``: TCP port number where the SSH server is listening.
  * ``keyfile``: path to the (private) key file to use for SSH public
    key authentication.
  * ``ssh_config``: path to a SSH configuration file, where to read
    additional options from.  The format of the SSH configuration file
    is documented in the `ssh_config(5)`__ man page.
  * ``ssh_timeout``: maximum amount of time (in seconds) that GC3Pie will
    wait for the SSH connection to be established.

.. __: http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi/OpenBSD-current/man5/ssh_config.5?query=ssh_config&sec=5

.. note::

  We advise you to use the SSH config file for setting port, key file,
  and connection timeout.  Options ``port``, ``keyfile``, and
  ``timeout`` could be deprecated in future releases.


``pbs`` resources
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following configuration keys are required in a ``pbs``-type resource section:

  * ``transport``: Possible values are: ``ssh`` or ``local``.  If
    ``ssh``, we try to connect to the host specified in ``frontend``
    via SSH in order to execute Troque/PBS commands.  If ``local``,
    the Torque/PBS commands are run directly on the machine where
    GC3Pie is installed.

  * ``frontend``: should contain the `FQDN (Fully-qualified domain
    name)`:abbr: of the Torque/PBS front-end node. This configuration
    item is only relevant if ``transport`` is ``local``. An SSH
    connection will be attempted to this node, in order to submit jobs
    and retrieve status info.

GC3Pie uses standard command line utilities to interact with the
resource manager. By default these commands are searched using the
``PATH`` environment variable, but you can specify the full path of
these commands and/or add some extra options. The following options
are used by the PBS backend:

  * ``queue``: the name of the queue to which jobs are submitted. If
    empty (the default), no job will be specified during submission.

  * ``qsub``: submit a job.

  * ``qdel``: cancel a job.

  * ``qstat``: get the status of a job or the status of available
    resources.

  * ``tracejob``: get info on resources used by a job.

If ``transport`` is ``ssh``, then the following options are also read
and take precedence above the corresponding options set in the "auth"
section:

  * ``port``: TCP port number where the SSH server is listening.
  * ``keyfile``: path to the (private) key file to use for SSH public
    key authentication.
  * ``ssh_config``: path to a SSH configuration file, where to read
    additional options from.  The format of the SSH configuration file
    is documented in the `ssh_config(5)`__ man page.
  * ``ssh_timeout``: maximum amount of time (in seconds) that GC3Pie will
    wait for the SSH connection to be established.

.. __: http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi/OpenBSD-current/man5/ssh_config.5?query=ssh_config&sec=5

.. note::

  We advise you to use the SSH config file for setting port, key file,
  and connection timeout.  Options ``port``, ``keyfile``, and
  ``timeout`` could be deprecated in future releases.


``lsf`` resources
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following configuration keys are required in a ``lsf``-type resource section:

  * ``transport``: Possible values are: ``ssh`` or ``local``.  If
    ``ssh``, we try to connect to the host specified in ``frontend``
    via SSH in order to execute LSF commands.  If ``local``, the LSF
    commands are run directly on the machine where GC3Pie is
    installed.

  * ``frontend``: should contain the `FQDN (Fully-qualified domain
    name)`:abbr: of the LSF front-end node. This configuration item is
    only relevant if ``transport`` is ``local``. An SSH connection
    will be attempted to this node, in order to submit jobs and
    retrieve status info.

GC3Pie uses standard command line utilities to interact with the
resource manager. By default these commands are searched using the
``PATH`` environment variable, but you can specify the full path of
these commands and/or add some extra options. The following options
are used by the LSF backend:

  * ``bsub``: submit a job.

  * ``bjobs``: get the status and resource usage of a job.

  * ``bkill``: cancel a job.

  * ``lshosts``: get info on available resources.

LSF commands use a weird formatting: lines longer than 79 characters
are wrapped around, and the continuation line starts with a long run
of spaces.  The length of this run of whitespace seems to vary with
LSF version; GC3Pie is normally able to auto-detect it, but there can
be a few unlikely cases where it cannot.  If this ever happens, the
following configuration option is here to help:

  * ``lsf_continuation_line_prefix_length``: length (in characters) of
    the whitespace prefix of continuation lines in ``bjobs`` output.
    This setting is normally not needed.

If ``transport`` is ``ssh``, then the following options are also read
and take precedence above the corresponding options set in the "auth"
section:

  * ``port``: TCP port number where the SSH server is listening.
  * ``keyfile``: path to the (private) key file to use for SSH public
    key authentication.
  * ``ssh_config``: path to a SSH configuration file, where to read
    additional options from.  The format of the SSH configuration file
    is documented in the `ssh_config(5)`__ man page.
  * ``ssh_timeout``: maximum amount of time (in seconds) that GC3Pie will
    wait for the SSH connection to be established.

  and connection timeout.  Options ``port``, ``keyfile``, and
  ``timeout`` could be deprecated in future releases.


``slurm`` resources
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following configuration keys are required in a ``slurm``-type resource section:

  * ``transport``: Possible values are: ``ssh`` or ``local``.  If
    ``ssh``, we try to connect to the host specified in ``frontend``
    via SSH in order to execute SLURM commands.  If ``local``, the
    SLURM commands are run directly on the machine where GC3Pie is
    installed.

  * ``frontend``: should contain the `FQDN (Fully-qualified domain
    name)`:abbr: of the SLURM front-end node. This configuration item
    is only relevant if ``transport`` is ``local``. An SSH connection
    will be attempted to this node, in order to submit jobs and
    retrieve status info.

GC3Pie uses standard command line utilities to interact with the
resource manager. By default these commands are searched using the
``PATH`` environment variable, but you can specify the full path of
these commands and/or add some extra options. The following options
are used by the SLURM backend:

  * ``sbatch``: submit a job.

  * ``scancel``: cancel a job.

  * ``squeue``: get the status of a job or of the available resources.

  * ``sacct``: get info on resources used by a job.

If ``transport`` is ``ssh``, then the following options are also read
and take precedence above the corresponding options set in the "auth"
section:

  * ``port``: TCP port number where the SSH server is listening.
  * ``keyfile``: path to the (private) key file to use for SSH public
    key authentication.
  * ``ssh_config``: path to a SSH configuration file, where to read
    additional options from.  The format of the SSH configuration file
    is documented in the `ssh_config(5)`__ man page.
  * ``ssh_timeout``: maximum amount of time (in seconds) that GC3Pie will
    wait for the SSH connection to be established.

  and connection timeout.  Options ``port``, ``keyfile``, and
  ``timeout`` could be deprecated in future releases.


``shellcmd`` resources
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following optional configuration keys are available in a
``shellcmd``-type resource section:

  * ``transport``: Like any other resources, possible values are
    ``ssh`` or ``local``. Default value is ``local``.

  * ``frontend``: If `transport` is `ssh`, then `frontend` is the
    `FQDN (Fully-qualified domain name)`:abbr: of the remote machine
    where the jobs will be executed.

  * ``time_cmd``: `ShellcmdLrms`:class: needs the GNU implementation
    of the command `time` in order to get resource usage of the
    submitted jobs. ``time_cmd`` must contains the path to the binary
    file if this is different from the standard (``/usr/bin/time``).

  * ``override``: `ShellcmdLrms`:class: by default will try to gather
    information on the system the resource is running on, including
    the number of cores and the available memory. These values may be
    different from the values stored in the configuration file. If
    ``override`` is `True`, then the values automatically discovered
    will be used. If ``override`` is `False`, the values in the
    configuration file will be used regardless of the real values
    discovered by the resource.

  * ``spooldir``: Path to a filesystem location where to create
    temporary working directories for processes executed through this
    backend. The default value `None` means to use ``$TMPDIR`` or
    `/tmp`:file: (see `tempfile.mkftemp` for details).

If ``transport`` is ``ssh``, then the following options are also read
and take precedence above the corresponding options set in the "auth"
section:

  * ``port``: TCP port number where the SSH server is listening.
  * ``keyfile``: path to the (private) key file to use for SSH public
    key authentication.
  * ``ssh_config``: path to a SSH configuration file, where to read
    additional options from.  The format of the SSH configuration file
    is documented in the `ssh_config(5)`__ man page.
  * ``ssh_timeout``: maximum amount of time (in seconds) that GC3Pie will
    wait for the SSH connection to be established.

.. __: http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi/OpenBSD-current/man5/ssh_config.5?query=ssh_config&sec=5

.. note::

  We advise you to use the SSH config file for setting port, key file,
  and connection timeout.  Options ``port``, ``keyfile``, and
  ``timeout`` could be deprecated in future releases.


``ec2+shellcmd`` resource
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following configuration options are available for a resource of
type ``ec2+shellcmd``. If these options are omitted, then the default
of the `boto`_ python library will be used, which at the time of
writing means use the default region on Amazon.

  * ``ec2_url``: The URL of the EC2 frontend. On a typical OpenStack
     installation this will look like:
     ``https://cloud.gc3.uzh.ch:8773/services/Cloud``, while for
     amazon it's something like
     ``https://ec2.us-east-1.amazonaws.com`` (this is valid for the
     zone ``us-east-1`` of course).
     If no value is specified, the environment variable ``EC2_URL``
     will be used, and if not found an error is raised.

  * ``ec2_region``: the region you want to access to. Most OpenStack
    installations only have one region called ``nova``.

  * ``keypair_name``: the name of the keypair to use when creating a
    new instance on the cloud. If it's not found, a new keypair with
    this name and the key stored in ``public_key`` will be
    used. Please note that if the keypair exists already on the cloud
    but the associated public key is different from the one stored in
    ``public_key``, then an error is raised and the resource will not
    be used.

  * ``public_key``: public key to use when creating the
    keypair. Please note that GC3Pie will assume that the
    corresponding private key is stored on a file with the same path
    but without the ``.pub`` extension. This private key is necessary
    in order to access the virtual machines created on the cloud.
    **Amazon users**: Please note that Amazon does not accept **DSA**
    keys; use RSA keys only for Amazon resources.

  * ``vm_auth``: the name of a valid ``auth`` stanza used to connect
    to the virtual machine.

  * ``instance_type``: the instance type (aka *flavor*, aka *size*)
    you want to use for your virtual machines by default.

  * ``<application>_instance_type``: you can override the default
    instance type for a specific application by defining an entry in
    the configuration file for that application. For example::

        instance_type=m1.tiny
        gc_gps_instance_type=m1.large

    will use instance type ``m1.large`` for the ``gc_gps`` GC3Pie
    application, and ``m1.tiny`` for all the other applications.

  * ``image_id``: the **ami-id** of the image you want to
    use. OpenStack users: please note that the ID you will find on the
    web interface **is not** the *ami-id*. To get the *ami-id* of an
    image you have to use the command ``euca-describe-images`` from
    the ``euca2ools`` package.

    For `Hobbes`_ users: all virtual machines distributed by the GC3
    team are in this `list of appliances`_ with the corresponding
    ami-id.

  * ``<application>_image_id``: you can override the default image id
    for a specific application by defining an entry in the
    configuration file for that specific application. For example::

      image_id=ami-00000048
      gc_gps_image_id=ami-0000002a

    will use the image ``ami-0000002a`` for ``gc_gps`` and image
    ``ami-00000048`` for all other applications.

  * ``security_group_name``: the name of the security group to use. If
    not found, it will be created using the rules found in
    ``security_group_rules``. If the security group is found but some
    of the rules in ``security_group_rules`` are not present, they
    will be added to the security groups. Please note that if the
    security group defines some rule which is not listed in
    ``security_group_rules`` it will **not** be removed from the
    security group.

  * ``security_group_rules``: comma separated list of security rules
    the ``security_group`` must have. Each rule is in the form::

      PROTOCOL:PORT_RANGE_START:PORT_RANGE_END:IP_NETWORK

    where:

    -  ``PROTOCOL`` can be one of ``tcp``, ``udp``, ``icmp``
    - ``PORT_RANGE_START`` and ``PORT_RANGE_END`` are integers and
      define the range of ports to allow. If ``PROTOCOL`` is ``icmp``
      please use ``-1`` for both values since in ``icmp`` there is no
      concept of *port*.
    - ``IP_NETWORK`` is a range of IP to allow in the form
      ``A.B.C.D/N``.

    For instance, to allow access to the virtual machine from *any*
    machine in the internet you can use::

      tcp:22:22:0.0.0.0/0

    Please note that in order to be able to access the created virtual
    machines GC3Pie **needs** to be able to connect via ssh, so the
    above rule is probably necessary in any gc3pie configuration. (of
    course, you can allow only your IP address or the IPs of your
    institution)

  * ``vm_pool_max_size``: the maximum number of Virtual Machine GC3Pie
    will start on this cloud. If `0`, there is no predefined limit to
    the number of virtual machines GC3Pie will spawn.

  * ``user_data``: the *content* of a script that will run after the
    startup of the machine. For instance, to automatically upgrade a
    ubuntu machine after startup you can use::

      user_data=#!/bin/bash
        aptitude -y update
        aptitude -y safe-upgrade

    Please note that if you need to span over multiple lines you have
    to indent the lines after ``user_data``, as any indented line in a
    configuration file is interpreted as a continuation of the
    previous line.

  * ``<application>_user_data``: you can override the default userdata
    for a specific application by defining an entry in the
    configuration file for that specific application. For example::

      # user_data=
      warholize_user_data = #!/bin/bash
        aptitude update && aptitude -y install imagemagick

    will install `imagemagick` only for the `warholize` application.


Example ``resource`` sections
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Example 1.* This configuration stanza defines a resource to submit
jobs to the `Grid Engine`_ cluster whose front-end host is
``ocikbpra.uzh.ch``::

    [resource/ocikbpra]
    # A single SGE cluster, accessed by SSH'ing to the front-end node
    type = sge
    auth = <auth_name> # pick an ``ssh`` type auth, e.g., "ssh1"
    transport = ssh
    frontend = ocikbpra.uzh.ch
    gamess_location = /share/apps/gamess
    max_cores_per_job = 80
    max_memory_per_core = 2
    max_walltime = 2
    ncores = 80

*Example 2.* This configuration stanza defines a resource to submit
jobs on virtual machines that will be automatically started by GC3Pie
on `Hobbes`_, the private OpenStack cloud of the University of Zurich::

    [resource/hobbes]
    enabled=yes
    type=ec2+shellcmd
    ec2_url=http://hobbes.gc3.uzh.ch:8773/services/Cloud
    ec2_region=nova

    auth=ec2hobbes
    # These values my be overwritten by the remote resource
    max_cores_per_job = 8
    max_memory_per_core = 2
    max_walltime = 8
    max_cores = 32
    architecture = x86_64

    keypair_name=my_name
    # If keypair does not exists, a new one will be created starting from
    # `public_key`. Note that if the desired keypair exists, a check is
    # done on its fingerprint and a warning is issued if it does not match
    # with the one in `public_key`
    public_key=~/.ssh/id_dsa.pub
    vm_auth=gc3user_ssh
    instance_type=m1.tiny
    warholize_instance_type = m1.small
    image_id=ami-00000048
    warholize_image_id=ami-00000035
    security_group_name=gc3pie_ssh
    security_group_rules=tcp:22:22:0.0.0.0/0, icmp:-1:-1:0.0.0.0/0
    vm_pool_max_size = 8
    user_data=
    warholize_user_data = #!/bin/bash
        aptitude update && aptitude install -u imagemagick


Enabling/disabling selected resources
-------------------------------------

Any resource can be disabled by adding a line ``enabled = false`` to its
configuration stanza.  Conversely, a line ``enabled = true`` will undo
the effect of an ``enabled = false`` line (possibly found in a different
configuration file).

This way, resources can be temporarily disabled (e.g., the cluster is
down for maintenance) without having to remove them from the
configuration file.

You can selectively disable or enable resources that are defined in
the system-wide configuration file.  Two main use cases are supported:
the system-wide configuration file :file:``/etc/gc3/gc3pie.conf`` lists and
enables all available resources, and users can turn them off in their
private configuration file :file:``~/.gc3/gc3pie.conf``; or the system-wide
configuration can list all available resources but keep them disabled,
and users can enable those they prefer in the private configuration
file.

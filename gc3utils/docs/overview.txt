 Overview

GC3Libs takes an application-oriented approach to asynchronous
computing. A generic :class:`Application` class provides the basic
operations for controlling remote computations and fetching a result;
client code should derive specialized sub-classes to deal with a
particular application, and to perform any application-specific
pre- and post-processing.

The generic procedure for performing computations with GC3Libs is the
following:

  1. Client code creates an instance of an `Application` sub-class.

  2. Asynchronous computation is started by submitting the application
     object; this associates the application with an actual (possibly
     remote) computational job.

  3. Client code can monitor the state of the computational job; state
     handlers are called on the application object as the state
     changes.

  4. When the job is done, the final output is retrieved and a
     post-processing method is invoked on the application object.

At this point, results of the computation are available and can be
used by the calling program.  

The :class:`Application` class (and its sub-classes) alow client code
to control the above process by:

  1. Specifying the characteristics (computer program to run,
     input/output files, memory/CPU/duration requirements, etc.) of the
     corresponding computational job.  This is done by passing suitable
     values to the :class:`Application` constructor.  See the
     :class:`Application` constructor documentation for more info.

  2. Providing methods to control the "life-cycle" of the associated
     computational job: start, check execution state, stop, retrieve a
     snapshot of the output files.  There are actually two different
     interfaces for this, detailed below:
     
       1. A *passive* interface: a :class:`Core` or a
          :class:`Engine` object is used to start/stop/monitor jobs
          associated with the given application.  For instance::

            a = GamessApplication(...)

            # create a `Core` object; only one instance is needed
            g = Core(...)

            # start the remote computation
            g.submit(a)

            # periodically monitor job execution
            g.update_job_state(a)

            # retrieve output when the job is done
            g.fetch_output(a)

          The passive interface gives client code full control over
          the lifecycle of the job, but cannot support some use cases
          (e.g., automatic application re-start).

          As you can see from the above example, the passive interface
          is implemented by methods in the :class:`Core` and
          :class:`Engine` classes (they implement the same
          interface).  See those classes documentation for more details.

       2. An *active* interface: this requires that the
          :class:`Application` object be attached to a :class:`Core`
          or :class:`Engine` instance::

            a = GamessApplication(...)

            # create a `Core` object; only one instance is needed
            g = Core(...)

            # tell application to use the active interface
            a.attach(g)

            # start the remote computation
            a.submit()            

            # periodically monitor job execution
            a.update_job_state()

            # retrieve output when the job is done
            a.fetch_output()

          With the active interface, application objects can support
          automated restart and similar use-cases.

          When an :class:`Engine` object is used instead of a
          :class:`Core` one, the job life-cycle is automatically
          managed, providing a fully asynchronous way of executing
          computations. 

          The active interface is implemented by the :class:`Task`
          class and all its descendants (including :class:`Application`).

  3. Providing "state transition methods" that are called when a
     change in the job execution state is detected; those methods can
     implement application specific behavior, like restarting the
     computational job with changed input if the alloted duration has
     expired but the computation has not finished.  In particular, a
     `postprocess` method is called when the final output of an
     application is available locally for processing.

     The set of "state transition methods" currently implemented by
     the :class:`Application` class are: :meth:`new`,
     :meth:`submitted`, :meth:`running`, :meth:`stopped`,
     :meth:`terminated` and :meth:`postprocess`.  Each method is
     called when the execution state of an application object changes
     to the corresponding state; see each method's documentation for
     exact information.

In addition, GC3Libs provides *collection* classes, that expose
interfaces *2.* and *3.* above, allowing one to control a set of
applications as a single whole.  Collections can be nested (i.e., a
collection can hold a mix of :class:`Application` and
:class:`TaskCollection` objects), so that workflows can be implemented
by composing collection objects.

Note that the term *computational job* (or just *job*, for short) is
used here in a quite general sense, to mean any kind of computation
that can happen independently of the main thread of the calling
program.  GC3Libs currently provide means to execute a job as a
separate process on the same computer, or as a batch job on a remote
computational cluster.


Execution model of GC3Libs applications
=======================================

An `Application` can be regarded as an abstraction of an independent
asynchronous computation, i.e., a GC3Libs' `Application` behaves much
like an independent UNIX process (but it can actually run on a
separate remote computer). Indeed, GC3Libs' `Application` objects
mimic the POSIX process model: `Application` are started by a
parent process, run independently of it, and need to have their final
exit code and output reaped by the calling process.

The following table makes the correspondence between POSIX processes
and GC3Libs' `Application` objects explicit.

+--------------------+---------------------+------------------------+
|`os` module function|`Core` function      |purpose                 |
+====================+=====================+========================+
|exec                |Core.submit          |start new job           |
+--------------------+---------------------+------------------------+
|kill(..., SIGTERM)  |Core.kill            |terminate executing job |
+--------------------+---------------------+------------------------+
|wait(..., WNOHANG)  |Core.update_job_state|get job status          |
+--------------------+---------------------+------------------------+
|-                   |Core.fetch_output    |retrieve output         |
+--------------------+---------------------+------------------------+

.. note::

   1. With GC3Libs, it is not possible to send an arbitrary signal to
      a running job: jobs can only be started and stopped (killed).

   2. Since POSIX processes are always executed on the local machine,
      there is no equivalent of the GC3Libs `fetch_output`.



Application exit codes
----------------------

POSIX encodes process termination information in the "return code",
which can be parsed through `os.WEXITSTATUS`, `os.WIFSIGNALED`,
`os.WTERMSIG` and relative library calls.

Likewise, GC3Libs provides each :class:`Application` object with an
`execution.returncode` attribute, which is a valid POSIX "return
code".  Client code can therefore use `os.WEXITSTATUS` and relatives
to inspect it; convenience attributes `execution.signal` and
`execution.exitcode` are available for direct access to the parts of
the return code.  See :meth:`Run.returncode` for more information.

However, GC3Libs has to deal with error conditions that are not
catered for by the POSIX process model: for instance, execution of an
application may fail because of an error connecting to the remote
execution cluster.

To this purpose, GC3Libs encodes information about abnormal job
termination using a set of pseudo-signal codes in a job's
`execution.returncode` attribute: i.e., if termination of a job is due
to some grid/batch system/middleware error, the job's
`os.WIFSIGNALED(app.execution.returncode)` will be `True` and the
signal code (as gotten from `os.WTERMSIG(app.execution.returncode)`)
will be one of those listed in the :class:`Run.Signals` documentation.


Application execution states
----------------------------

At any given moment, a GC3Libs job is in any one of a set of
pre-defined states, listed in the table below.  The job state is
always available in the `.execution.state` instance property of any
`Application` or `Task` object; see :meth:`Run.state` for detailed
information.

+------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------+
|GC3Libs' Job state|purpose                                                       |can change to         |
+==================+==============================================================+======================+
|NEW               |Job has not yet been submitted/started (i.e., gsub not called)|SUBMITTED (by gsub)   |
+------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------+
|SUBMITTED         |Job has been sent to execution resource                       |RUNNING, STOPPED      |
+------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------+
|STOPPED           |Trap state: job needs manual intervention (either user-       |TERMINATED (by gkill),|
|                  |or sysadmin-level) to resume normal execution                 |SUBMITTED (by miracle)|
+------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------+
|RUNNING           |Job is executing on remote resource                           |TERMINATED            |
+------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------+
|TERMINATED        |Job execution is finished (correctly or not)                  |None: final state     |
|                  |and will not be resumed                                       |                      |
+------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------+

When an :class:`Application` object is first created, its
`.execution.state` attribute is assigned the state NEW.  After a
successful start (via `Core.submit()` or similar), it is transitioned
to state SUBMITTED.  Further transitions to RUNNING or STOPPED or
TERMINATED state, happen completely independently of the creator
program: the `Core.update_job_state()` call provides updates on the
status of a job. (Somewhat like the POSIX `wait(..., WNOHANG)` system
call, except that GC3Libs provide explicit RUNNING and STOPPED states,
instead of encoding them into the return value.)

The STOPPED state is a kind of generic "run time error" state: a job
can get into the STOPPED state if its execution is stopped (e.g., a
SIGSTOP is sent to the remote process) or delayed indefinitely (e.g.,
the remote batch system puts the job "on hold"). There is no way a job
can get out of the STOPPED state automatically: all transitions from the
STOPPED state require manual intervention, either by the submitting
user (e.g., cancel the job), or by the remote systems administrator
(e.g., by releasing the hold).

The TERMINATED state is the final state of a job: once a job reaches
it, it cannot get back to any other state. Jobs reach TERMINATED state
regardless of their exit code, or even if a system failure occurred
during remote execution; actually, jobs can reach the TERMINATED
status even if they didn't run at all! 

A job that is not in the NEW or TERMINATED state is said to be a "live" job.


Computational job specification
-------------------------------

One of the purposes of GC3Libs is to provide an abstraction layer
that frees client code from dealing with the details of job execution
on a possibly remote cluster. For this to work, it necessary to
specify job characteristics and requirements, so that the GC3Libs
scheduler can select an appropriate computational resource for
executing the job.

GC3Libs `Application` provide a way to describe computational job
characteristics (program to run, input and output files,
memory/duration requirements, etc.) loosely patterned after ARC's
xRSL_ language.

The description of the computational job is done through keyword
parameters to the :class:`Application` constructor, which see for
details.  Changes in the job characteristics *after* an
:class:`Application` object has been constructed are not currently
supported.

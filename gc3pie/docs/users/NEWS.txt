  release, items are added to the top of the file and identify the version
  they pertain to.

.. NOTE TO AUTHORS:

  Don’t discard old items; leave them in the file after the newer

GC3Pie 2.3.0 (currently in development)
=======================================

Incompatible changes
--------------------

* The environment variable ``GC3PIE_NO_CATCH_ERRORS`` now can specify a list of
  patterns to selectively unignore unexpected/generic errors in the code.  As
  this feature should only be used in debugging code, we allow ourselves to
  break backwards compatibility.

* The cloud and mathemtics libraries are no longer installed by
  default with ``pip install gc3pie`` -- please use::

        pip install gc3pie[openstack,ec2,optimizer]

  to install support for all optional backends and libraries.

* The `gc3libs.utils.ifelse` function was removed in favor of Python's
  ternary operator.


New features
------------

* New task collection `DependentTaskCollection`:class: to run a
  collection of tasks with given pre/post dependencies across them.

* GC3Pie will now parse and obey the ``Port``, ``Identity``, ``User``,
  ``ConnectionTimeout``, and ``ProxyCommand`` options from the SSH
  config file.  Location of an alternate configuration file to use
  with GC3Pie can be set in any ``[auth/*]`` section of type SSH; see
  the `configuration`:ref: reference for details.  Thanks to Niko
  Eherenfeuchter and Karandash8 for feature requests and preliminary
  implementations.

* Application prologue and epilogue scripts can now be embedded in the
  GC3Pie configuration file, or referenced by file name.

* New selection options have been added to the `gselect`:ref: command.


Important bug fixes
-------------------

* Shell metacharacters are now allowed in `Application` arguments.
  Each argument string is now properly quoted before passing it to the
  execution layer.

* LSF backend updated to work with *both* bjobs *and* bacct for
  accounting, or to parse information provided in the final output
  file as a last resort.


GC3Pie 2.2.0
============

New features
------------

* New ``openstack`` backend for running jobs on ephemeral VMs on
  OpenStack-compatible IaaS cloud systems.  This is preferred over the
  OpenStack EC2 compatibility layer.
* New configurable scheduler for GC3Pie's `Engine`:class:
* Session-based scripts can now snapshot the output of RUNNING jobs at
  every cycle.
* ARC backends are now deprecated: they will be removed in the next
  major version of GC3Pie.
* The ``pbs`` backend can now handle also Altair's PBSPro.

Changes to command-line utilities
---------------------------------

* ``gget``: New option `-A` to download output files of *all* tasks in a session.
* ``gget``: New option ``-c``/``--changed-only`` to only download
  files that have apparently changed remotely.
* The GC3Apps collection has been enriched with several new applications.

Important bug fixes
-------------------

* Working directory for remote jobs using the ``shellcmd`` backend is
  now stored in ``/var/tmp`` instead of ``/tmp``, which should allow
  results to be retrieved even after a reboot of the remote machine.


GC3Pie 2.1.0
============

New features and incompatible changes
-------------------------------------

* GC3Pie now requires Python 2.6 or above to run.
* New ``ec2`` backend for running jobs on ephemeral VMs on
  EC2-compatible IaaS cloud systems.
* New package `gc3libs.optimizer` to find local optima of functions
  that can be computed through a job.  Currently only implements the
  "Differential Evolution" algorithm, but the framework is generic
  enough to plug any genetic algorithm.
* New configuration options ``prolog_content`` and ``epilog_content``,
  to allow execute oneliners before or after the command without
  having to create an auxiliary file.
* New ``resourcedir`` option for ``shellcmd`` resources. This is used
  to modify the default value for the directory containing job
  informations.

Changes to command-line utilities
---------------------------------

* New command ``gcloud`` to interface with cloud-based VMs that were
  spawned by GC3Pie to run jobs.
* Table output now uses a different formatting (we use Python's
  `prettytable` package instead of the `texttable` package that we
  were using before, due to Py3 compatibility).



GC3Pie 2.0
==========

New features and incompatible changes
-------------------------------------

* GC3Pie can now run on MacOSX.
* A session now has a configurable storage location, which can be a
  directory on the filesystem (FilesystemStore, the default so far) or
  can be a table in an SQL database (of any kind supported by
  SQLAlchemy).
* New ARC1 backend to use ARC resources through the new NorduGrid 1.x library API.
* New backend "subprocess": execute applications as local processes.
* New backends for running on various batch-queueing systems: SLURM, LSF, PBS.
* Implement recursive upload and download of directories if they are
  specified in an `Application`'s `input` or `output` attribute.
* New execution state `TERMINATING`: task objects are in this state when execution is finished remotely, but the task output has not yet been retrieved.
* Reorganize documentation and move it to http://gc3pie.readthedocs.org/
* Script logging is now controlled by a single configuration file `.gc3/gc3utils.log.conf`
* Session-based scripts now print WARNING messages to STDERR by default (previously, only ERROR messages were logged).
* Add caching to ARC backends, to reduce the number of network queries.
* Use GNU ".~NUMBER~" format for backup directories.

Configuration file changes
--------------------------

* Rename ARC0 resource type to `arc0`

Changes to command-line utilities
---------------------------------

* New `gsession` command to manage sessions.
* The ``glist`` command was renamed to ``gservers``
* The ``gsub`` and ``gnotify`` commands were removed.
* The ``PATH`` tag no longer gets any special treatment in
  session-based scripts ``--output`` processing.
* ``ginfo``: New option ``--tabular`` to print information in table format.
* ``gkill``: New option `-A`/`--all` to remove all jobs in a session.
* Use the `rungms` script to execute GAMESS.

API changes
-----------

* Module ``gc3libs.dag`` has been renamed to ``gc3libs.workflow``.
* API changes in `gc3libs.cmdline.SessionBasedScript`:class: allow
  `new_tasks()` in `SessionBasedScript` instances to return `Task`
  instances instead of quadruples.
* Interpret `Application.requested_memory` as the *total* memory for the job.
* the ``Resource`` and ``LRMS`` objects were merged
* the ``gc3libs.scheduler`` module has been removed; its functionality is now incorporated in the ``Application`` class.
* configuration-related code moved into `gc3libs.config` module
* removed the application registry.
* New package `gc3libs.compat` to provide 3rd-party functionality that is not present in all supported versions of Python.
* Implement `gc3libs.ANY_OUTPUT` to retrieve the full contents of the output directory, whatever it is.
* New `RetryableTask` class to wrap a task and re-submit it on failure until some specified condition is met.


GC3Pie 1.0
==========

Configuration file changes
--------------------------

* Renamed configuration file to ``gc3pie.conf``: the file
  ``gc3utils.conf`` will no longer be read!
* SGE clusters must now have ``type = sge`` in the configuration file
  (instead of ``type = ssh-sge``)
* All computational resource must have an ``architecture = ...`` line;
  see the ConfigurationFile wiki page for details
* Probably more changes than it's worth to list here: check your
  configuration against the configuration_ page!

Command-line utilities changes
------------------------------

* GC3Utils and GC3Apps (``grosetta``/``ggamess``/etc.) now all accept
  a ``-s``/``--session`` option for locating the job storage
  directory: this allows grouping jobs into folders instead of
  shoveling them all into ``~/.gc3/jobs``.
* GC3Apps: replaced option ``-t``/``--table`` with
  ``-l``/``--states``. The new option prints a table of submitted jobs
  in addition to the summary stats; if a comma-separated list of job
  states follows the option, only job in those states are printed.
* Command ``gstat`` will now print a summary of the job states if the
  list is too long to fit on screen; use the -v option to get the full
  job listing regardless of its length.
* Command ``gstat`` can now print information on jobs in a certain
  state only; see help text for option ``--state``
* Removed ``-l`` option from ginfo; use ``-v`` instead.
* GC3Utils: all commands accepting multiple job IDs on the command
  line, now exit with the number of errors/failures occurred. Since
  exit codes are practically limited to 7 bits, exit code 126 means
  that more than 125 failures happened.


GC3Pie 0.10
===========

* First release for public use outside of GC3_

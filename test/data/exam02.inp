!    3-B-1 CH2    UHF calculation on methylene ground state.
!
!    This test uses the default choice, COORD=UNIQUE, to
!    enter the molecule.  Only the symmetry unique atoms
!    are given, and they must be given in the orientation
!    which GAMESS expects.
!
!    This job tests the UHF energy and the UHF gradient.
!    In addition, the orbitals are localized.
!
!    The initial energy is -37.228465066.
!    The FINAL energy is -37.2810867259 after 11 iterations.
!    The unrestricted wavefunction has <S**2> = 2.013.
!    Mulliken, Lowdin charges on C are -0.020584, 0.018720.
!    The spin density at Hydrogen is -0.0167104.
!    The dipole moment is 0.016188.
!    The RMS gradient is 0.027589766.
!    FINAL localization sums are 30.57 and 25.14 Debye**2.

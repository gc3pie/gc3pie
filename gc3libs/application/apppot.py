    Base class for AppPot-hosted applications.
    Provides the same interface as the base `Application`:class:
    and runs the specified command in an AppPot instance.

    In addition to the standard `Application`:class: keyword
    arguments, the following ones can be given to steer the AppPot
    execution:

    * `apppot_img`: Path or URL to the AppPot system image to use.
      If ``None`` (default), then the default AppPot system image
      on the remote system is used.

    * `apppot_changes`: Path or URL to an AppPot changes file to be merged
      at system startup.

    * `apppot_tag`: ARC RTE to use for submission of this AppPot job.

    * `apppot_extra`: List of additional UML boot command-line arguments.
      (Passed to the AppPot instance via ``apppot-start``'s ``--extra`` option.)

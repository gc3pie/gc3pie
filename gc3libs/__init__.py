GC3Libs is a python package for controlling the life-cycle of a Grid
or batch computational job.

GC3Libs provides services for submitting computational jobs to Grids
and batch systems, controlling their execution, persisting job
information, and retrieving the final output.

GC3Libs takes an application-oriented approach to batch computing. A
generic :class:`Application` class provides the basic operations for
controlling remote computations, but different :class:`Application`
subclasses can expose adapted interfaces, focusing on the most
relevant aspects of the application being represented.

    Configure the ``gc3.gc3libs`` logger.

    Arguments `level`, `format` and `datefmt` set the corresponding

    Argument `colorize` controls the use of the `coloredlogs`_ module to
    color-code log output lines.  The default value ``auto`` enables log
    colorization iff the `sys.stderr` stream is connected to a terminal;
    a ``True`` value will enable it regardless of the log output stream
    terminal status, and any ``False`` value will disable log
    colorization altogether.  Note that log colorization can anyway be
    disabled if `coloredlogs`_ thinks that the terminal is not capable
    of colored output; see `coloredlogs.terminal_supports_colors`__.
    If the `coloredlogs`_ module cannot be imported, a warning is logged

    Mix-in class implementing a facade for job control.

    A `Task` can be described as an "active" job, in the sense that
    all job control is done through methods on the `Task` instance
    itself; contrast this with operating on `Application` objects
    through a `Core` or `Engine` instance.

    The following pseudo-code is an example of the usage of the `Task`
    interface for controlling a job.  Assume that `GamessApplication` is
    inheriting from `Task` (it actually is)::

        t = GamessApplication(input_file)
        t.submit()

        t.update_state()
        # ... take decisions based on t.execution.state
        t.wait() # blocks until task is terminated

    Each `Task` object has an `execution` attribute: it is an instance
    of class :class:`Run`, initialized with a new instance of `Run`,
    and at any given time it reflects the current status of the
    associated remote job.  In particular, `execution.state` can be
    checked for the current task status.

    After successful initialization, a `Task` instance will have the
    following attributes:

    `changed`
      evaluates to `True` if the `Task` has been changed since last
      time it has been saved to persistent storage (see
      :mod:`gclibs.persistence`)

class Application(Task):

    """
    Support for running a generic application with the GC3Libs.

    The following parameters are *required* to create an `Application`
    instance:

    `arguments`
      List or sequence of program arguments. The program to execute is
      the first one.; any object in the list will be converted to
      string via Python's `str()`.

    `inputs`
      Files that will be copied to the remote execution node before
      execution starts.

      There are two possible ways of specifying the `inputs` parameter:

      * It can be a Python dictionary: keys are local file paths or
        URLs, values are remote file names.

      * It can be a Python list: each item in the list should be a pair
        `(source, remote_file_name)`: the `source` can be a local file
        or a URL; `remote_file_name` is the path (relative to the
        execution directory) where `source` will be downloaded.  If
        `remote_file_name` is an absolute path, an
        :class:`InvalidArgument` error is raised.

      A single string `file_name` is allowed instead of the pair
      and results in the local file `file_name` being copied to
      `file_name` on the remote host.

    `outputs`
      Files and directories that will be copied from the remote
      execution node back to the local computer (or a
      network-accessible server) after execution has completed.
      Directories are copied recursively.

      There are three possible ways of specifying the `outputs` parameter:

      * It can be a Python dictionary: keys are remote file or directory
        paths (relative to the execution directory), values are
        corresponding local names.

      * It can be a Python list: each item in the list should be a pair
        `(remote_file_name, destination)`: the `destination` can be a
        local file or a URL; `remote_file_name` is the path (relative to
        the execution directory) that will be uploaded to `destination`.
        If `remote_file_name` is an absolute path, an
        :class:`InvalidArgument` error is raised.

      A single string `file_name` is allowed instead of the pair
      and results in the remote file `file_name` being copied to
      `file_name` on the local host.

      * The constant `gc3libs.ANY_OUTPUT` which instructs GC3Libs to
        copy every file in the remote execution directory back to the
        local output path (as specified by the `output_dir` attribute).

      Note that no errors will be raised if an output file is not present.
      Override the `terminated`:meth: method to raise errors for reacting
      on this kind of failures.

    `output_dir`
      Path to the base directory where output files will be downloaded.
      Output file names are interpreted relative to this base directory.

    `requested_cores`,`requested_memory`,`requested_walltime`
      Specify resource requirements for the application:

      * the number of independent execution units (CPU cores; all are
        required to be in the same execution node);

      * amount of memory (as a `gc3libs.quantity.Memory`:class: object)
        for the task as a whole, i.e., independent of number of CPUs
        allocated;

      * amount of wall-clock time to allocate for the computational job
        (as a `gc3libs.quantity.Duration`:class: object).

    The following optional parameters may be additionally
    specified as keyword arguments and will be given special
    treatment by the `Application` class logic:

    `requested_architecture`
      specify that this application can only be executed on a certain
      processor architecture; see `Run.Arch`:class: for a list of
      possible values.  The default value `None` means that any
      architecture is valid, i.e., there are no requirements on the
      processor architecture.

    `environment`
      a dictionary defining environment variables and the values to
      give them in the task execution setting.  Keys of the dictionary
      are environmental variables names, and dictionary values define
      the corresponding variable content.  Both keys and values must
      be strings or convertible to string; keys (environment variable
      names) must be ASCII-only or a ``UnicodeDecodeError`` will be
      raised.

      For example, to run the application in an environment where the
      variable ``LC_ALL`` has the value ``C`` and the variable ``HZ``
      has the value ``100``, one would use::

        Application(...,
          environment={'LC_ALL':'C', 'HZ':100},
        ...)

    `output_base_url`
      if not `None`, this is prefixed to all output files (except
      stdout and stderr, which are always retrieved), so, for
      instance, having `output_base_url="gsiftp://example.org/data"`
      will upload output files into that remote directory.

    `stdin`
      file name of a file whose contents will be fed as
      standard input stream to the remote-executing process.

    `stdout`
      name of a file where the standard output stream of
      the remote executing process will be redirected to; will be
      automatically added to `outputs`.

    `stderr`
      name of a file where the standard error stream of
      the remote executing process will be redirected to; will be
      automatically added to `outputs`.

    `join`
      if this evaluates to `True`, then standard error is
      redirected to the file specified by `stdout` and `stderr` is
      ignored.  (`join` has no effect if `stdout` is not given.)

    `jobname`
      a string to display this job in user-oriented listings

    `tags`
      list of tag names (string) that must be present on a
      resource in order to be eligible for submission.

    Any other keyword arguments will be set as instance attributes,
    but otherwise ignored by the `Application` constructor.

    After successful construction, an `Application` object is
    guaranteed to have the following instance attributes:

    `arguments`
    list of strings specifying command-line arguments for executable
    invocation. The first element must be the executable.

    `inputs`
      dictionary mapping source URL (a `gc3libs.url.Url`:class:
      object) to a remote file name (a string); remote file names are
      relative paths (root directory is the remote job folder)

    `outputs`
      dictionary mapping remote file name (a string) to a destination
      (a `gc3libs.url.Url`:class:); remote file names are relative
      paths (root directory is the remote job folder)

    `output_dir`
      Path to the base directory where output files will be
      downloaded.  Output file names (those which are not URLs) are
      interpreted relative to this base directory.

    `execution`
      a `Run` instance; its state attribute is initially set to ``NEW``
      (Actually inherited from the `Task`:class:)

    `environment`
      dictionary mapping environment variable names to the requested
      value (string); possibly empty

    `stdin`
      ``None`` or a string specifying a (local) file name.  If `stdin`
      is not None, then it matches a key name in `inputs`

    `stdout`
      ``None`` or a string specifying a (remote) file name.  If `stdout`
      is not None, then it matches a key name in `outputs`

    `stderr`
      ``None`` or a string specifying a (remote) file name.  If `stdout`
      is not None, then it matches a key name in `outputs`

    `join`
      boolean value, indicating whether `stdout` and `stderr` are
      collected into the same file

    `tags`
      list of strings specifying the tags to request in each resource
      for submission; possibly empty.

        Return a dictionary formed by pairs `URL:name` or `name:URL`.
        The `URL` part is a tuple as returned by functions `urlparse`
        and `urlsplit` in the Python standard module
        `urlparse`:module: -- `name` is a string that should be
        interpreted as a filename (relative to the job execution
        directory).

        Argument `ctor` is the constructor for the dictionary class to
        return; `gc3libs.url.UrlKeyDict` and
        `gc3libs.url.UrlValueDict` are valid values here.

        Argument `spec` is either a list or a Python `dict` instance.

        If a Python `dict` is given, then it is copied into an
        `gc3libs.url.UrlDict`, and that copy is returned::

          /tmp/2

        If `spec` is a list, each element can either be a tuple
        `(path, name)`, or a string `path`, which is converted to a

        =============== ============================================= ======================

        When a :class:`Run` object is first created, it is assigned
        the state NEW.  After a successful invocation of
        `Core.submit()`, it is transitioned to state SUBMITTED.
        Further transitions to RUNNING or STOPPED or TERMINATED state,
        happen completely independently of the creator progra; the
        `Core.update_job_state()` call provides updates on the status
        of a job.

        The STOPPED state is a kind of generic "run time error" state:
        a job can get into the STOPPED state if its execution is
        stopped (e.g., a SIGSTOP is sent to the remote process) or
        delayed indefinitely (e.g., the remote batch system puts the
        job "on hold"). There is no way a job can get out of the
        STOPPED state automatically: all transitions from the STOPPED
        state require manual intervention, either by the submitting
        user (e.g., cancel the job), or by the remote systems
        administrator (e.g., by releasing the hold).

        The TERMINATED state is the final state of a job: once a job
        reaches it, it cannot get back to any other state. Jobs reach
        TERMINATED state regardless of their exit code, or even if a
        system failure occurred during remote execution; actually,
        jobs can reach the TERMINATED status even if they didn't run
        at all, for example, in case of a fatal failure during the
        submission step.

        Convert shell exit code to POSIX process return code.
        The "return code" is represented as a pair `(signal,
        exitcode)` suitable for setting the ``returncode`` property.

        A POSIX shell represents the return code of the last-run
        program within its exit code as follows:

        * If the program was terminated by signal ``K``, the shell exits
          with code ``128+K``,

        * otherwise, if the program terminated with exit code ``X``,
          the shell exits with code ``X``.  (Yes, the mapping is not
          bijective and it is possible that a program wants to exit
          with, e.g., code 137 and this is mistaken for it having been
          killed by signal 9.  Blame the original UNIX implementors
          for this.)

        Examples:

        * Shell exit code 137 means that the last program got a
          SIGKILL. Note that in this case there is no well-defined
          "exit code" of the program; we use ``-1`` in the place of
          the exit code to mark it::

            >>> Run.shellexit_to_returncode(137)
            (9, -1)

        * Shell exit code 75 is a valid program exit code::

            >>> Run.shellexit_to_returncode(75)
            (0, 75)

        * ...and so is, of course, 0::

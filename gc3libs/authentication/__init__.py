class Auth(object):

    """
    A mish-mash of authorization functions.

    This class actually serves the purposes of:

    - a registry of authorization 'types', mapping internally-assigned
      names to Python classes;
    - storage for the configuration information (which can be
      arbitrary, but should probably be read off a configuration
      file);
    - a factory, returning a 'SomeAuth' object through which clients
      can deal with actual authorization issues (like checking if the
      authorization credentials are valid and getting/renewing them).
    - a cache, that tries to avoid expensive re-initializations of
      `Auth` objects by allowing only one live instance per type, and
      returning it when requested.

    .. admonition:: FIXME

      There are several problems with this approach:

      - the configuration is assumed *static* and cannot be changed after
        the `Auth` instance is constructed.
      - there is no communication between the client class and the
        `Auth` classes.
      - there is no control over the lifetime of the cache; at a
        minimum, it should be settable per-auth-type.
      - I'm unsure whether the mapping of 'type names' (as in the
        `type=...` keyword in the config file) to Python classes
        belongs in a generic factory method or in the configuration
        file reader.  (Probably the former, so the code here would
        actually be right.)
      - The whole `auto_enable` stuff really belongs to the user-interface
        part, which is also hard-coded in the auth classes, and should not be.

        Additional keyword arguments are passed unchanged to the class
        constructor and can override values specified at configuration time.

        Instances are remembered for the lifetime of the program; if
        an instance of the given class is already present in the

          The `params` keyword arguments are only used if a new

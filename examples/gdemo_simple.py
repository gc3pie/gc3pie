"""
This is a basic script to demonstrate the basics of GC3Pie.

This simple script will create an instance of a `GdemoSimpleApp` class
which inherits from `Application`:class and which basically run the
command `/bin/hostname`.

It will create an instance of `Engine`:class and will submit the
`GdemoSimpleApp` instance, check its status until the application is
terminated and then fetch the output.

You can specify the resource you want to use by passing its name as
command line argument.

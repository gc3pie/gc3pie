#  THIS IS JUST AN EXAMPLE CONFIGURATION FILE.  No computing resources
#  are currently defined; please edit the file and define resources

[DEFAULT]
# The `DEFAULT` section is entirely optional; if present, its values can
# be used to interpolate values in other sections, using the `%(name)s` syntax.
# See documentation of the `SafeConfigParser` object at:

# Authorization section
#
# You can have as many `authorization/name` sections as you want;
# this allows you to define different auths for different resources.
# Each `resource/***` section will reference one (and one only) auth
# section.
#
# Examples:
#
# [authorization/smscg]
# type = voms
# aai_username = <your_aai_user_name>
# idp = uzh.ch
# vo = smscg
#
# [authorization/ssh1]
# type = ssh
# username = <your_ssh_user_name>
#
# If you have a different account name on some resources, you can create
# another authorization section with, e.g.
#
# [authorization/ssh2]
# type = ssh
# username = <your_other_ssh_user_name>


# Resource section
# [resource/<resource_name>]
#
# You can have as many `resource/name` sections as you want; this
# allows you to define many different resources.  Each `resource/***`
# section must reference one (and one only) `authorization/name`
# section (in the `authorization_type` key).
#
# Examples:
#
# [resource/gc3]
# # A single cluster, accessed through the ARC middleware
# type = arc
# authorization_type = <voms_auth_type_name>
# frontend = idgc3grid01.uzh.ch
# name = gc3
# arc_ldap = ldap://idgc3grid01.uzh.ch:2135/mds-vo-name=resource,o=grid
# max_cores_per_job = 32
# max_memory_per_core = 2
# max_walltime = 12
# ncores = 80
# walltime = 12
#
#
# [resource/ocikbpra]
# # A single SGE cluster, accessed by SSH'ing to the front-end node
# type = ssh_sge
# authorization_type = <ssh_auth_type_name>
# frontend = ocikbpra.uzh.ch
# gamess_location = /share/apps/gamess
# max_cores_per_job = 80
# max_memory_per_core = 2
# max_walltime = 2
# ncores = 80
# # see http://gridengine.info/2005/11/04/immediate-accounting-data-flushing
# # if you need to lower this

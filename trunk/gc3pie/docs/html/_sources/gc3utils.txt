-----------------------
 The GC3Utils software
-----------------------

The GC3Utils are lower-level commands, provided to perform common
operations on jobs, regardless of their type or the application they run.

For instance, GC3Utils provide commands to obtain the list and status
of computational resources (:command:`glist`); to clear the list of jobs from
old and failed ones (:command:`gclean`); to get detailed information on a
submitted job (:command:`ginfo`, mainly for debugging purposes).

This chapter is a tutorial for the GC3Utils command-line utilities.

If you find a technical term whose meaning is not clear to you, please
look it up in the :ref:`glossary`. (But feel free to ask on the
`GC3Pie mailing list`_ if it's still unclear!)

:command:`gstat`: monitor the status of submitted jobs
======================================================

To see the status of all the jobs you have submitted, use the
:command:`gstat` command.  Typing::

    gstat

will print to the screen a table like the following::

    Job ID    Status    
    ====================
    job.12    TERMINATED
    job.15    SUBMITTED
    job.16    RUNNING
    job.17    RUNNING
    job.23    NEW

.. note:: 

   If you have never submitted any job, or if you have cleared
   your job list with the :command:`gclean` command, then :command:`gstat` will
   print *nothing* to the screen!

A job can be in one and only one of the following states:

``NEW``

  The job has been created but not yet submitted: it only exists on
  the local disk.  

``RUNNING``

  The job is currently running -- there's nothing to do but wait.

``SUBMITTED``

  The job has been sent to a compute resource for execution -- it
  should change to ``RUNNING`` status eventually.

``STOPPED``

  The job was sent to a remote cluster for execution, but it is stuck
  there for some unknown reason.  There is no automated procedure in
  this case: the best thing you can do is to contact the systems
  administrator to determine what has happened.

``TERMINATED``

  The job has finished running; now there are three things you can do:

    1. Use the :command:`gget` command to get the command output files back
       from the remote execution cluster.
    2. Use the :command:`gclean` command to remove this job from the list.
       After issuing :command:`gclean` on a job, any information on it is
       lost, so be sure you have retrieved any interesting output with
       :command:`gget` before!
    3. If something went wrong during the execution of the job (it did
       not complete its execution or -possibly- it did not even
       start), you can use the :command:`ginfo` command to try to debug the
       problem.
  
The list of submitted jobs persists from one session to the other: you
can log off, shut your computer down, then turn it on again next day
and you will see the same list of jobs.

.. note:: 
   Completed jobs persist in the :command:`gstat` list until they are
   cleared off with the :command:`gclean` command.


:command:`gtail`: peeking at the job output and error report
============================================================

Once a job has reached ``RUNNING`` status (check with :command:`gstat`), you
can also monitor its progress by looking at the last lines in the job
output and error stream.  

An example might clarify this: assume you have submitted a
long-running computation as *job.16* and you know from :command:`gstat` that
it got into ``RUNNING`` state; then to take a peek at what this job is
doing, you issue the following command::

    gtail job.16

This would produce the following output, from which you can deduce how
far GAMESS_ has progressed into the computation::

    RECOMMEND NRAD ABOVE  50 FOR ZETA'S ABOVE 1E+4

    RECOMMEND NRAD ABOVE  75 FOR ZETA'S ABOVE 1E+5

    RECOMMEND NRAD ABOVE 125 FOR ZETA'S ABOVE 1E+6

    DFT IS SWITCHED OFF, PERFORMING PURE SCF UNTIL SWOFF THRESHOLD IS REACHED.


    ITER EX DEM     TOTAL ENERGY        E CHANGE  DENSITY CHANGE    DIIS ERROR

      1  0  0    -1079.0196780290 -1079.0196780290   0.343816910   1.529879639

By default, :command:`gtail` only outputs the last 10 lines of a job
output/error stream. To see more, use the command line option ``-n``;
for example, to see the last 25 lines of the output, issue the command::

    gtail -n 25 job.16

The command :command:`gtail` is especially useful for long computations: you
can see how far a job has gotten and, e.g., cancel it if it's gotten
stuck into an endless/improductive loop.

To "keep an eye" over what a job is doing, you can add the ``-f`` option
to :command:`gtail`: this will run :command:`gtail` in "follow" mode, i.e.,
:command:`gtail` will continue to display the contents of the job output and
update it as time passes, until you hit Ctrl+C to interrupt it.


:command:`gkill`: cancel a running job
======================================

To cancel a running job, you can use the command :command:`gkill`.  For
instance, to cancel *job.16*, you would type the following command
into the terminal::

    gkill job.16

.. warning:: 

   *There's no way to undo a cancel operation!* Once you have issued a
   :command:`gkill` command, the job is deleted and it cannot be resumed.
   (You can still re-submit it with :command:`gresub`, though.)


:command:`gget`: retrieve the output of finished jobs
=====================================================

Once a job has reached ``RUNNING`` status (check with :command:`gstat`),
you can retrieve its output files with the :command:`gget` command.  For
instance, to download the output files of *job.15* you would use::

  gget job.15

This command will print out a message like::

  Job results successfully retrieved in '/path/to/some/directory'

If you are not running the :command:`gget` command on your copmputer, but
rather on a shared front-end like `ocikbgtw`, you can copy+paste the
path within quotes to the sftp_ command to get the files to your
usual workstation.  For example, you can run the following command in
a terminal on your computer to get the output files back to your
workstation::

  sftp ocikbgtw:'/path/to/some/directory'

This will take you to the directory where the output files have been stored.

:command:`gclean`: remove a completed job from the status list
==============================================================

Jobs persist in the :command:`gstat` list until they are cleared off; you
need to use the :command:`gclean` command for that.

Just call the :command:`gclean` command followed by the job identifier
*job.NNN*.  For example::

  gclean job.23

In normal operation, you can only remove jobs that are in the
``TERMINATED`` status; if you want to force :command:`gclean` to remove a job
that is not in any one of those states, just add ``-f`` to the command
line.


:command:`gresub`: re-submit a failed job
=========================================

In case a job failed for accidental causes (e.g., the site where it
was running went unexpectedly down), you can re-submit it with the
:command:`gresub` command.

Just call :command:`gresub`  followed by the job identifier
*job.NNN*.  For example::

    gresub job.42

Resubmitting a job that is not in a terminal state (i.e.,
``TERMINATED``) results in the job being killed (as with :command:`gkill`)
before being submitted again.  If you are unsure what state
a job is in, check it with :command:`gstat`.


:command:`glist`: list available resources
==========================================

The :command:`glist` command prints out information about the configured resources.
For each resource, a summary of the information recorded in the configuration
file and the current resource status is printed.  For example::

    $ glist
    +----------------------------------------------------------------+
    |                     smscg                                      |

    |                      Authorization name / auth   smscg         |
    |                          Accessible? / updated   1             |

    |                     Total queued jobs / queued   3475          |
    |                  Own queued jobs / user_queued   0             |
    |                    Own running jobs / user_run   0             |

    |  Max walltime per job (minutes) / max_walltime   1440          |
    +----------------------------------------------------------------+

The meaning of the printed fields is as follows:

* The title of each box is the "resource name", as you would write it
  after the `-r` option to :command:`gsub`.
* *Access mode / type*: it is the kind of software that is used for
  accessing the resource; consult Section `configuration`:ref: for more
  information about resource types.
* *Authorization name / auth*: this is paired with the *Access mode /
  type*, and identifies a section in the `configuration file
  <configuration>`:ref: where authentication information for this
  resource is stored; see Section `configuration`:ref: for more
  information.
* *Accessible? / updated*: whether you are *currently* authorized to
  access this resource; note that if this turns *False* or *0* for
  resources that you should have access to, then something is wrong
  either with the state of your system, or with the resource itself.
  (The procedure on how to diagnose this is too complex to list here;
  consult your friendly systems administrator :-))
* *Total nunber of cores*: the total number of cores present on the
  resource.  Note this can vary over time as cluster nodes go in and
  out of service: computers break, then are repaired, then break
  again, etc.
* *Total queued jobs*: number of jobs (from all users) waiting to be
  executed on the remote compute cluster.
* *Own queued jobs*: number of jobs (submitted by you) waiting to be
  executed on the remote compute cluster.
* *Own running jobs*: number of jobs (submitted by you) currently
  executing on the remote compute cluster.
* *Max cores per job*: the maximum nunber of cores that you can
  request for a single computational job on this resource.
* *Max memory per core*: maximum amount of memory (per core) that you
  can request on this resource.  The amount shows the maximum
  requestable memory in MB.
* *Max walltime per job*: maximum duration of a computational job on
  this resource. The amount shows the maximum time in seconds.

The whole point of GC3Utils is to abstract job submission and
management from detailed knowledge of the resources and their hardware
and software configuration, but it is sometimes convenient and
sometimes necessary to get into this level of detail...


:command:`ginfo`: accessing low-level details of a job
======================================================

It is sometimes necessary, for debugging purposes, to print out all
the details about a job; the :command:`ginfo` command does just that: prints
all the details that GC3Utils know about a single job.

For instance, to print out detailed information about `job.13` in
session `TEST1`, you would type::

    ginfo -s TEST1 job.13

For a job in ``RUNNING`` or ``SUBMITTED`` state, only little
information is known: basically, where the job is running, and when it
was started::

    $ ginfo -s XXX job.13
    job.13
        execution_targets: hera.wsl.ch
        log: 
            SUBMITTED at Wed Mar  7 17:40:07 2012
            Submitted to 'smscg' at Wed Mar  7 17:40:07 2012
        lrms_jobid: gsiftp://hera.wsl.ch:2811/jobs/593513311384071771546195
        resource_name: smscg
        state_last_changed: 1331138407.33
        timestamp: 
            SUBMITTED: 1331138407.33

If you omit the job number, information about *all* jobs in the
session will be printed.

Most of the output is only useful if you are familiar with GC3Utils
inner working. Nonetheless, :command:`ginfo` output is definitely something
you should include in any report about a misbehaving job!

For a finished job, the information is more complete and can include
error messages in case the job has failed::

    $ ginfo -s TEST1 job.13
    job.13
        cores: 1

With option ``-v``, :command:`ginfo` output is even more verbose and complete,
and includes information about the application itself, the input and
output files, plus some backend-specific information::
